ANGIOPHAGE,3,"For years, the Ankaseri faction sold an artificial heart graft, one that increased the stamina and strength of its recipients. Like many grafts available in Ruk, the Ankaseri heart required little in the way of medical support to transplant; it was ""self-installing."" A graft recipient need only lie back, unseal the graft membrane, and take a tranquilizer so as not to experience anything untoward. Hours later, the recipient woke with a stronger, better heart and only a scar to show for it. No one thought to ask what would become of the original heart. As was later revealed, Ankaseri secretly weaponized their heart grafts. Upon receiving a proper phrase or passcode, followed by instructions given audibly or while the recipient was connected by umbilical to the All Song, a heart would leave off its duties in a recipient's chest, dig its way out, and attack a designated target from ambush. Afterward, it would crawl away and hide. This tended to leave two corpses, neither of which had hearts—just clawed-up, empty chest cavities. After the Ankaseri faction was eliminated for other reasons, many transplanted heart grafts remained, all of which were hungry and able to reproduce.","Hungers for hearts, reproduction Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually among the populace of Harmonious Health: 9 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 2 Movement: Immediate Modifications: Stealth as level 4; Speed defense as level 4 due to size. Combat: A ""transplanted"" angiophage need merely burst forth to kill an unsuspecting host. Against fresh targets, the angiophage prefers to use stealth and ambush, possibly even waiting until a target is naturally asleep. The angiophage can make two different attacks, each a separate action. One attack is an anesthetizing bite. If the victim fails a Speed defense roll, it takes just 1 point of damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed Might defense, the victim falls unconscious for one minute. Left undisturbed, the angiophage opens up the target's chest, carefully feeds on the target's heart as it equally carefully replaces the functions of the original heart, and sews itself into the target's chest. This process, thanks to enzymatic healing and anesthetizing mucus, leaves behind only a slight scar, and the target may not even realize what's happened. Once installed, an angiophage is content to remain quiescent for several weeks, at which point it grows hungry again, and emerges to feed. The angiophage's other attack is a bite attack that deals normal damage. Interaction: The angiophage is about as sophisticated as a virus. Use: A contact the PCs have traveled to see is found dead with no heart. Alternatively, he stops midsentence and a hungry angiophage bursts out of his chest.","Usually among the populace of Harmonious Health: 9 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 2 Movement: Immediate Modifications: Stealth as level 4; Speed defense as level 4 due to size.

GREEN HOMUNCULUS,3,"A homunculus with barely a trace of soul almost invariably comes out of the Body Vats with the brains of a beetle. Greens are slightly above that grade, and they possess a rough likeness to the Betrayer in war regalia, though they stand only about 5 feet (2 m) high and possess just a hint of his aggressive reflexes. They do enjoy one gruesome customization: a second, extendible mouth. Mostly, greens are beasts, and they serve higher homunculi grades as sword fodder. Greens can understand simple commands in the Maker's Tongue, but they can't speak intelligibly; they only gibber. An unfortunate side effect of homunculi creation limits the amount of nutrition they can absorb, so they are always hungry and will eat anything. If not watched, they even resort to cannibalism.","Hungers for flesh Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands, usually in groups of five, often in the company of a red homunculus leader Health: 15 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short Modifications: Stealth actions as level 1 due to nearly constant gibbering; all knowledge-based skills at level 1. Combat: A green homunculus attack is sudden and surprising, despite the gibbering; its maw instantly disgorges a thick, tonguelike proboscis tipped with a second set of jaws with the force of a spear thrust. If its victim fails an Intellect defense roll, the green gains the initiative, and the difficulty to dodge its initial attack is increased by one step. If a green strikes a living character, the secondary mouth latches on in an unbreakable jaw grip. The victim is hindered by the attachment, and his attacks against the green are modified by one step to the victim's detriment. Each subsequent round the green remains attached, the green automatically inflicts damage. This automatic damage also ignores most forms of Armor. The only way to detach a green homunculus that is actively feeding is to kill it. Interaction: No interaction is possible other than violence or intimidation. Green homunculi can be intimidated into fleeing by a startling display (like wild animals can), such as killing their leader or pulling off another impressive or unexpected stunt. Use: The PCs witness a trade shipment from a distant part of Ardeyn dropped by accident.

RED HOMUNCULUS,5,"Red homunculi serve the Betrayer in a variety of roles, having the intelligence and initiative of a normal, if slightly underperforming, human.

CHAOSPHERE HIERARCH,5,"A Chaosphere hierarch is a quickened native of a recursion from the Shoals of Earth, usually from Ardeyn, who has gained a power over the Strange itself. This influence allows a hierarch to transit across the Strange in a relative blink of an eye, or banish a foe across the Strange to a place it might never find a way back from. This power was gained at a price. Chaosphere hierarchs have divested themselves so fully from their previous selves that they may appear and act radically different than what they once were.","Knowledge and power Environment (the Strange): Anywhere, including a recursion in a contextually appropriate form Health: 36 Damage Inflicted: 7 points Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Attacks made with artifacts as level 7. Combat: A hierarch possesses one or more artifacts that provide it with many options in combat. Such an artifact might allow a hierarch to make a ranged energy attack (electricity, fire, magic, radiation, or another less recognizable force) at long range against up to three foes at once. A hierarch might also possess any or all of the following abilities, which require the hierarch's action: Banish: A target that fails her Intellect defense roll is cast into the Strange in a random direction and a distance requiring 1d6 + 2 hours of transit time to return from, assuming she can find a way back. The disorientation of the effect renders the victim initially lost in the Strange, and alienation applies. Cleave: The hierarch uses a melee weapon to attack every foe in immediate range as a single action. The hierarch can do this only every other round. Rune of Will: A target who fails an Intellect defense roll must follow the Chaosphere hierarch's audible directions for up to one minute, as long as she can see the hierarch (who has drawn fractal designs on its flesh to engender the effect). Vanish: The hierarch could decide to flee a fight and ""banish"" itself, though when it does so, it appears near a previously prepared site out in the Strange. Interaction: Different hierarchs have different personalities, but most are arrogant and dismissive of others' needs—and this arrogance is difficult to manipulate. A hierarch also can be amazingly manipulative if it sees an advantage to be gained through interaction over combat. Use: A hierarch has translated into a recursion or onto Earth to gain access to a vault containing a trove of cyphers. Discovering the hierarch's true nature and purpose comes about accidentally, perhaps when PCs arrive to loot the vault themselves.

CYPHER EATER,3,"The 10-foot-long (3 m) cypher eater grazes on manifestations of energy that crystallize out of the Strange. It prefers violet spiral, cyphers, and reality seeds. Able to surf the dark energy network if necessary, a cypher eater prefers to stay anchored to massive pieces of fundament when possible, especially fundament with elaborate texture that allows the creature to hide amid nooks and crannies. Akin to a terrestrial shark's electroreception sense, a cypher eater's ""chaoreception"" allows it to sense cyphers and similar objects within long range, even if such objects are stowed or otherwise cached. Cypher eaters are lone scouts—actually just one part of a highly developed hive of creatures, each of which has a specialized task or function within the community. A cypher eater has the role of community provider.","Hunger for cyphers and similar physical manifestations of the Strange Environment (the Strange): Anywhere Health: 17 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short Modifications: Perception as level 8 for tasks related to sensing cyphers and similar manifestations of the Strange.

(The cypher eater must choose to extend its ability in this way, which means it could also choose to keep the effect in check.) If a cypher eater bites a target, it focuses its special sense into the prey, who takes 2 points of damage as described above. In addition to that damage, one random cypher, violet spiral, reality seed, or similar object carried by the target detonates. The detonation inflicts a number of points of damage equal to the item's level on everything in immediate range, except for the cypher eater; instead of taking damage, the cypher eater regains a number of points of health equal to the level of the object, and may exceed its normal maximum health when it does so.

DARK ENERGY PHARAOH,8,"Recursions created through the fictional bleed of previous human civilizations on Earth exist, but they are rare. That's mostly because fewer people lived on the planet long ago, which provided far fewer opportunities for fictional leakage to occur. One long-ago recursion was seeded by belief in the ancient Egyptian afterlife and included the likenesses of many pharaohs waking into their promised heavenly kingdoms. Many of these pharaohs gained the spark and eventually quickened. Soon after, war followed among the pharaohs. As their recursion collapsed into the Strange, most of the ""demigods"" fled. Some were lost, but some survived out in the dark energy network, mostly by adapting, scavenging, and preying on the shadows in other recursions and on aspects of the Strange. The pharaohs incorporated the magic, mad science, and fringe developments they found in other recursions into themselves. Sometimes, a pharaoh's activities in these recursions was enough to collapse it. A handful of dark energy pharaohs survive in the Strange to this day.","Hunger for powerful abilities, cyphers, and artifacts Environment (the Strange): Anywhere Health: 60 Damage Inflicted: 10 points Armor: 4 Movement: Short; long while flying Combat: Dark energy pharaohs use the abilities, artifacts, and cyphers they've collected for attack and defense.

DEMON OF LOTAN,5,"If a wandering spirit in Ardeyn is not corralled by the Court of Sleep, it descends the endless dark roads until the fires of Lotan engulf it, transforming the spirit into an ashen demon pledged to the Sinner. A demon remembers only fragments of its life—every good memory is cauterized and every slight, misfortune, snub, and pain is amplified. The resulting mind knows only hate and the desire to tempt others into the same state as itself. Having no flesh, a revealed demon is a shadowed, ephemeral horror. This immaterial nature allows it to possess others. A demon can cause great harm in a short time by forcing its possessed host to lie, steal, and deliver violence upon loved ones.","Hungers for others' pain and fear Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere Health: 30 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 2 Movement: Short; immediate while flying Modifications: All stealth tasks as level 7. Combat: A demon can attack a creature with its touch. Either the touch inflicts 5 points of damage as the target's form is decayed and eroded by necrosis, or the demon can attempt to possess the target. The target of an attempted possession must make an Intellect defense roll or become possessed, whereupon the demon's form disappears into the target. The first round a character is possessed, he can act normally. On the second and subsequent rounds, the possessing demon can control the actions of the host, but the character can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action. Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one round. On other rounds, the character can act as he chooses. A possessing demon's actions are limited to attempts to control its host and leaving the host. A possessed target is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the demon once per day, barring any exorcism attempts. The difficulty of the defense roll increases by 1 for each day of possession after the first seven days. A demon not possessing another creature can pass through solid objects whose level is less than its own. Interaction: A demon allows a possessed host to act normally, as long as it doesn't reveal the demon's presence. If its presence is known, the demon might negotiate, but only after a tirade of lies and obscenity, and the demon likely betrays any deal reached. Use: A crypt found beneath a newer structure has demons within it.

DLAMMA,6,"Dlammas are believed to be champions of the weak and downtrodden in Ardeyn, which is true often enough to keep the perception alive. Dlammas are creatures of the Age of Myth, when they served as steeds of qephilim who fought human dragon riders in the war against Lotan. A relative handful survived to the present age, but most dlammas alive today are younger. Many retain a semblance of the protective nature attributed to the original dlamma, but some—the bleak dlammas—have become twisted. Dlammas reproduce, but they do so only very rarely. A legendary dlamma spawning ground called Isum—one of the skerries in northern Ardeyn—is sometimes a site sought by adventuring companies, thanks to the legend that dlamma egg fragments insulate against the effects of magic.","Protection Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Daylands or Borderlands, usually alone Health: 32 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Perception, Ardeyn lore as level 7. Combat: Dlamma visual senses are incredibly sharp, so much so that even from half a mile (0.8 km) in the sky, they can see details as if they were in immediate range (though at night, they must be within long range to gain the same level of awareness). They can attack with their hooves, making two attacks as a single action. However, dlammas are more feared for the words of power they use to heal, create shelter, and even move elements. In combat, they fall back on a Word of Smiting, an attack that inflicts 6 points of damage on up to three targets within long range. When they use Word of Healing, they can confer the ability to regenerate 2 points of damage each round for one minute upon themselves or upon a target within immediate range (if a creature is reduced to 0 health, the regeneration ends early). Interaction: To call upon a dlamma, folk wisdom dictates that a petitioner should engrave the image of the creature on a clay tablet and bury it at a crossroads. If a dlamma is anywhere near, it is drawn to the location thanks to sympathetic sorcery. What a dlamma decides to do upon arriving, however, might be far different than what the petitioner had in mind. Even dlammas who retain their protective urges are realists, and they rarely help others without at least a promise of payment in return.

DRAGON,7,"The massive, feathered dragons of Ardeyn are exceptionally territorial and competitive. They love games of all sorts, especially ones that end with the nondragon loser being eaten. Unfortunately for civilized folks, dragons view war as a kind of game and the capture of human and qephilim holdings as moves in some wider contest, the rules of which only dragons understand. In the same way, a dragon's hoard is not only an end in itself, but part of a never-ending tournament among dragons of a certain age to see which one can accumulate the largest trove. Other, less known contests are also likely ongoing. According to legend, dragons were first made by Lotan. Asking a dragon whether that's true is the best way to get off on the wrong foot.","Winning at games large and small Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere Health: 52 Damage Inflicted: 7 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Perception as level 8. Speed defense as level 6 due to size. Combat: A dragon can bite one target or claw two opponents in immediate range as a single action. When bitten, the target is also immobilized until he succeeds on a Might defense roll to break free (or the dragon drops him). Most dragons have one or more additional magical abilities they can bring to bear in combat, including the following. Fiery Breath: A dragon can breathe a stream of fire up to long range, doing 7 points of damage to all targets within immediate range of each other. Targets who succeed on a Speed defense roll to avoid the full effect of the fire still take 3 points of damage from the flame. This ability cannot be used on consecutive rounds. Change Shape: A dragon with this ability can take the form of a human or qephilim as its action, or return to its regular shape. When so changed, the disguise is nearly impenetrable without special knowledge. As a human or qephilim, the dragon is a level 5 creature. Captivate: A dragon with this ability can psychically mesmerize a nondragon target in immediate range who fails an Intellect defense roll. A captivated target does the dragon's verbal bidding for one or more days. Each time the target is confronted by a third party about its mental condition, the target is allowed another Intellect defense roll to break the effect. Demon Fire: Some dragons still secretly serve Lotan. The taint of such a dragon's fiery breath provides a conduit that demons can follow to afflict fresh vessels. Once a day when such a dragon breathes its fiery breath, targets who take full damage from the fire become vulnerable to demonic possession. If these targets fail a second difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll (which is the attack made by a demon attempting to possess a target), the victim is indeed possessed by a demon of Lotan. Interaction: Like the colors of dragon feathers, dragon personalities run the gamut from beastly thug to refined connoisseur. Some dragons lie with every smoky breath, others consider the least bit of dishonesty a personal failing, and most fall somewhere in between. Use: A dragon confronts the PCs, challenging them to a riddle game with the following rules: if the PCs win, they get a cypher. If the dragon wins, the PCs owe the dragon a favor to be specified later. Loot: A dragon usually carries a couple of cyphers and 1d6 × 10 gold crowns.

GIANT,6,"The evidence of a giant's rampage is discovered more often than the perpetrator herself. That's because the curse of gigantism usually triggers its growth in a victim only during storms or when a normally human-sized victim becomes emotionally stressed or overexcited. The rest of the time, a giant is human-sized and appears (and may live) just like a regular human. Episodes of gigantism, when the giant is as tall as a tree and as wide as a house, are forgotten by the giant, except perhaps only as a vague dream.  After the curse really takes hold, a giant eventually learns the truth, perhaps by waking to find her house smashed and her family and friends severely injured or dead from being thrown across the valley. As a result, many giants live alone in the wilderness, possibly desiring the company of others, but knowing that no one is safe around them for long. The curse of gigantism is normally passed by blood, but since it doesn't strike a victim until her thirty-fifth year of life (and sometimes skips generations altogether), stamping it out has proved especially problematic. Most sufferers would've chosen not to have children had they known their parent or grandparent was a giant.","Destruction Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands, mountains Health: 40 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Movement: Short Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size. Breaks and throws objects as level 8. Combat: A giant smashes foes with her mighty fists, possibly catching up to three human-sized targets with the same attack if all the targets are in immediate range of each other. If a giant attacks a single target, she can choose to do regular damage or to grab hold of her victim, dealing 4 points of damage instead. On his turn, the victim can attempt a Might defense roll to power out of the grip, a Speed defense roll to slip out, or an Intellect-based task to try to distract the giant. If the victim fails, the giant throws him as high and as far as she can on her next turn. Damage on impact varies, depending on the surrounding environment, but a victim takes an average of 10 points of ambient damage. Interaction: When a giant is raging (which is always, when she's a giant), the only possible interaction is an attempt to distract her by singing, juggling, or creating some other flagrant display, which some giants will pause to watch. Each additional round trying to distract a giant (whether the previous round was successful or not) increases the difficulty of the task by one step. Use: During the last spring storm, a giant came down out of the mountains and laid waste to half a village. Survivors put together an appeal for someone to venture into the giant's mountain lair and destroy him.","Borderlands, mountains Health: 40 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Movement: Short Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size.

GNATHOSTOME,4,"Gnathostomes lurk in dark places, preying on other creatures using ambush tactics. They are drawn to inhabited locations because such places offer plenty of the cerebrospinal fluid and fatty brain tissue they require to survive. Related to 3-foot-high (1 m) autonomous ecology samplers used by some research factions, gnathostomes improve on a ""tame"" sampler's ability to remain hidden in plain sight, and more insidiously, a sampler's ability to debilitate a subject to extract a biological sample. How gnathostomes evolved from samplers used for research isn't precisely known, but to discover the answer, tame samplers have been programmed to seek out and conduct bioassays on gnathostomes. This has resulted in something of a minor gnathostome-sampler war being carried out beyond the notice of most Ruk citizens.","Hungers for cerebrospinal fluid Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere near inhabited locations Health: 12 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 3 Movement: Short, long when jumping Modifications: Perception as level 5; stealth as level 6; Speed defense as level 5 due to size.

GOLEM,6,"Golems were summoned to mobility by Incarnations during the Age of Myth to serve as soldiers, couriers, and banner-bearers. Now that those wars are over and the Incarnations are gone, many golems remain without purpose or master. Most have ceased moving, becoming statuary posed in unexpected places—stained, eroded, and forlorn. Sometimes one will wake if disturbed, and depending on the state of its remaining mind, could either attempt to communicate, or try to smash those responsible for waking it once more to a purposeless existence. Because golems were the creation of the Incarnations, most are heavily inscribed with symbology related to a particular Incarnation, and they may have a shape that recalls that Incarnation as well. As a result, a golem of War or Death can be quite imposing, though a golem of Silence might go unnoticed.","Seeks dissolution or purpose Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere Health: 18 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 5 Movement: Short Modifications: Intellect defense and resistance to trickery as level 3; Speed defense as level 4 due to speed. Combat: Skilled with large two-handed weapons, golems inflict an additional 2 points of damage (total of 8 points) when using them. Golems cannot be stunned or dazed. They are immune to most poisons and disease, and 2 of their 5 points of Armor protect against ambient damage (environmental damage, heat, cold, falling, and so on). A golem can stamp the ground with its prodigious weight, creating a shock wave that causes all creatures in range to take 3 points of damage. In addition, they fall down or are pushed out of immediate range. Some golems have the ability to freeze in place, becoming as still as a statue. When one does so, its Armor increases to 10 (and Armor against ambient damage increases to 5), but it can take no actions, including purely mental actions. Unless something can damage the golem through its Armor, it remains frozen indefinitely. Even if a golem is completely destroyed, the rubble of its form slowly reassembles over the course of three days, unless that rubble is ground to the finest gravel and spread across recursions. Interaction: Most golems are mournful, and a few have become cruel in their isolation, but at heart, all are lonely. Many are also tired of their stone existence, where they can move but not really feel, and they wish for some sort of final end. Use: Powerful sorcerers sometimes seek out golems and press them into service with spells, or with the promise of release from their long lives in return for a few favors. Such golems prove to be tough bodyguards, but sometimes the futility of such service overcomes a golem and it turns on the sorcerer, breaking free of the binding spells in its rage over being denied the peace of death.","Anywhere Health: 18 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 5 Movement: Short Modifications: Intellect defense and resistance to trickery as level 3; Speed defense as level 4 due to speed.

GREEN ONE,4,"Green ones are a warrior race in the recursion of Old Mars. The green-skinned adults stand around 15 feet (5 m) high. They sport large eyes, tusks, and two fully functioning sets of arms. The green ones wage war across the face of Old Mars, tribe against tribe. The most well known is the green ones' ""kingdom"" of Sharnak, which takes its name from the deserted city they use as a capital. Green ones are an egg-laying species, but like turtles on Earth, the hatchlings are left to fend for themselves inside low-walled incubators that soak in sunlight by day and keep the eggs moderately warm at night. When born, hatchlings with any obvious abnormality are slain to keep the race strong.","Gathering resources, eliminating competitors Environment (Old Mars | Mad Science): Anywhere, usually in groups of four or more Health: 22 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Movement: Short Modifications: Perception and attacks as level 5. Combat: In melee, a green one can attack with both a spear and its tusks as a single action. Many green ones are also armed with rifles that deal 8 points of damage to one target within long range on a successful attack. After each shot, preparing for the next is a minute-long process. (Particularly important green ones might have special rifles that can fire every other round using radium pellets that deal 10 points of damage, with a range of a mile or more.) Sometimes a war party of green ones ride multilegged, vicious mounts. A green one riding a mount defends as a level 6 creature and can move a long distance each round. Their mounts are level 3 creatures with 9 health and 1 point of Armor. Interaction: Green ones are typically warlike and cruel, but they count honor as the highest virtue. So it's possible to convince some that honor is best served not by slaying enemies and parading the resulting heads around on spears, but instead by seeking a more diplomatic solution to differences.

HYDRA,6,"A hydra is a hideous predator with five or more heads. Legend says the very first hydra was formed when a coterie of human sorcerers who served Lotan were slain, and their severed heads were thrown into a cursed well. Some thread of evil magic remained in those heads, binding the souls together in a form of hideous life, which crawled back out three days later as a hydra. Hydras scavenge for food like regular beasts, but their favorite fare is human flesh, except for the head. Heads without merit are left to rot, but those with useful bits of knowledge or skill are incorporated onto a hydra. At first, such a head begs and pleads for release from the horror of its new existence, but eventually it seems to find peace as part of the collective, and it becomes as eager to sample new flesh as any of the other heads.","Hungers for flesh, high-value human heads Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands Health: 24 Damage Inflicted: 2 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Perception as level 7 due to its many heads; Speed defense as level 4 due to size. Combat: A hydra is an exceptionally dangerous foe, given that all five of its heads can simultaneously bite foes in immediate range. If three or more heads coordinate their attack, the heads make one attack as a single level 7 creature dealing 12 points of damage. If a human target is killed by a hydra, the hydra regenerates 5 points of health and gains the killed target's head as a new one of its own on the following round. A newly acquired head retains its previous motivations, but it can take only purely verbal or mental actions. The heads of a hydra also possess remnants of previous abilities from back when they were still people. Any head not involved in a direct physical attack can use one of these abilities, once per round. Interaction: A hydra talks among itself, almost to the exclusion of interacting with other sentient creatures. Very rarely will a hydra bargain, especially if it means forgoing the buffet of human flesh right in front of it in return for a later reward. Use: The PCs investigate a qephilim ruin hoping to find artifacts of the ancient war between Lotan and the Incarnations.

One is the inkling snatcher, which can drain the color and substance from a creature when it feeds, until nothing is left of a victim but formless shadow: a lesser inkling. The more an inkling snatcher consumes of a creature, the more it comes to look like its prey.","Hungers for life, color, and substance Environment (the Strange): Anywhere undisturbed, at the center of a large swarm of lesser inklings or wandering alone Health: 42 Damage Inflicted: 7 points Movement: Long Modifications: Defends as level 3 against melee attacks due to desire to be struck (see combat). Combat: The touch of an inkling snatcher inflicts 7 points of ambient damage. An inkling snatcher can also suck light in immediate range as an action once every other round, inflicting 4 points of ambient damage to living creatures. Form and color seem to flow from the victim to the inkling with each successful attack. An inkling regains health equal to half the number of points of damage it deals to creatures (or adds the total to its maximum health if  already fully healthy). Each time a foe successfully attacks an inkling snatcher, he suffers 2 points of ambient damage, as shadow substance from the wound splashes the attacker back. Each time a foe takes 7 or more points of damage from an inkling snatcher attack, he must make a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the foe descends one step on the damage track. If a foe is killed by an inkling, nothing is left but a shadow (a fledgling lesser inkling). Meanwhile, the inkling snatcher takes on the visage, abilities, and personality of the just-consumed. Indeed, for one day, the snatcher may believe it is the victim, until a strange hunger awakes (and the snatcher's stolen form and color begin to leach away). Bright light (as bright as direct sunlight or brighter) modifies all tasks, attacks, and defenses of an inkling snatcher by two steps to its detriment. Interaction: Meaningful interaction with an inkling snatcher is impossible, unless the snatcher still retains most of the form and mind of a previous victim. Use: Inklings are considered a threat that must be burned out whenever they are confronted, or fled from if too prolific. Loot: Sometimes an inkling snatcher with a victim's likeness has a couple of cyphers and an artifact from that victim.","Anywhere undisturbed, at the center of a large swarm of lesser inklings or wandering alone Health: 42 Damage Inflicted: 7 points Movement: Long Modifications: Defends as level 3 against melee attacks due to desire to be struck (see combat).

JABBERWOCK,7,"Overhearing the burbling jabber of three quarrelsome siblings is unpleasant at best. At worst, it could portend the imminent appearance of the jabberwock. Given how disagreeable such a meeting would likely be, one's best option in that situation is to run. Due to the creature's frumious manner, no one alive can claim to be an expert on its habits, demeanor, and nature. That doesn't stop people from trying to figure out why the three heads—one named Jabberwock (for which the whole creature is known), one named Jubjub, and the last named Bandersnatch—are always so angry with each other. At least one thing's clear: if someone wanted to slay the beast by cutting off its head, the task would require three decapitations, not one.","Unknown Environment (Wonderland | Magic): In the wabe Health: 32 Damage Inflicted: 7 points Armor: 4, 15 against fire Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size. Combat: Each of the jabberwock's three heads can attack a different target with a bite within a single action. Alternatively, the jabberwock can spend its action to make two claw attacks, and either deal damage or catch the prey in its grip. On subsequent rounds, the jabberwock automatically bites prey caught in its front claws (leaving one or two heads free to bite other foes that are not yet caught). The only physical action a human-sized victim caught in a jabberwock's claw can take is to attempt a Might-based or Speed-based roll to escape the creature's clutches. Once every other round, the jabberwock can breathe heat (or cold), inflicting damage on up to ten targets within short range of each other and within long range of the jabberwock. Even on a successful Speed defense roll, targets still take 1 point of fire (or cold) damage. Interaction: A jabberwock usually puts aside the quarrels among its heads to eat prey, but crafty interaction could turn the jabberwock on itself, at least for a time. Use: The jabberwock's lair contains a trove of amazing items, and perhaps the PCs need one in particular.

KRAY SCURRIER,3,"A kray seedling that takes root in a living creature needs to gestate for only a few minutes before spitting out a kray scurrier: part crayfish, part spider, and all nightmare. A kray scurrier's body is about the size of a human head, but despite its relatively small size, the creature is an amoral and fearless predator with one goal: eat from the flesh of the recursion where it finds itself. A kray scurrier usually doesn't have to eat much before it molts to become a larger kray drone.","Hungers for flesh Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Usually in the Borderlands or Green Wilds, alone or in scuttles of up to ten Health: 12 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 2 Movement: Short Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to small size.

KRAY DRONE,5,"When a kray scurrier eats enough, it molts (over the course of one round) and, from a space too small to hold it, a kray drone emerges. A kray drone's torso is human-sized, but when standing on its many legs, it's two and a half times taller than a human. The front two pincers have spinnerets on the end and each can spray webbing.

KRO COURSER,4,"The magicians of Crow Hollow can work a lot of mischief after they've accumulated enough power in the form of crow coin. A magician with three chests of crow coin, a mystic recipe for making coursers, and buy-off from the Beak Mafia can transform a recently deceased kro corpse into an animate and quite dangerous kro courser. A kro courser pack answers to the commands of anyone who holds their leash (created at the same time and via the same magic as the kro coursers). Most leashes remain in the hands of mafiosos, but sometimes courser leashes are given as gifts to visiting crime kingpins, or are stolen. If a leash is destroyed, the associated courser or pack attacks all nearby creatures without restraint. A kro courser is not really alive; it's magically animated and preserved flesh.

MARROID,6,"These monstrous, genetic abnormalities are the size of small vehicles and look a bit like creatures that evolved from something that started life underwater. Marroids (also called marrow seekers) constantly produce dribbles of enzymatic fluid, even when they're not engaged in feeding. Marroids began existence as a genetically engineered tool. Designed for passively sampling the environment for genetic code, marroids experienced mutation and neglect that gave rise to a whole new class of creature, one that sometimes appears where damage to Ruk's physical structure has occurred, but one that is always looking for fresh marrow to sample.","Hungers for the marrow of living creatures Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere in Ruk that has seen a recent disturbance Health: 23 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short; can burrow into solid Ruk foundation as an action. When it burrows into the ground, the tunnel closes up after it like a quickly healing wound. Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size. Combat: A marroid can attack with its battering tail. It can also launch enzyme orbs from its body, targeting any point within long range, at a rate of one orb per round. The orb explodes in immediate range. The marrow seeker can choose to launch different kinds of orbs with each attack. Acidic: Targets who fail a Might defense roll take 6 points of damage. Those who succeed still take 1 point of damage from the spray of acid. Numbing: Targets who fail a Speed defense roll are partly anesthetized for one minute. During that period, they have a hard time holding objects because of numb fingers. Any time a creature uses a held object, it must first succeed on a Speed-based task or drop the item. Brain Fog: Targets who fail an Intellect defense roll experience neurological impairment for one minute, which affects characters like blindness. A marroid, once it downs at least one foe, is happy to leave a conflict so it can break open its prey's bones with repeated tail bashes, then suck out the marrow. Interaction: Some marroids who've obtained the marrow of intelligent Ruk natives can access bits of their victims' knowledge. If approached with fresh marrow, a marroid may deign to transfer memories through a carefully crafted enzyme orb. Use: The Church of the Embodiment believes that a particular marroid may possess hints of the True Code that can be had nowhere else. The Church is looking for contractors to find and capture this particular marroid for further study. Loot: Sometimes one or two enzyme orbs can be salvaged from the body of a slain marroid.

MONITOR,5,"Monitors are remnant Qephilim of Silence who went into hiding when the Incarnation of Silence disappeared. Now they exist like ghosts, haunting the world, watching in silence as they always have. They are disengaged from every other organization, waiting for a sign from the Incarnation of Silence, one that may never come. Qephilim of the ancient orders did not all have the same visage, despite the similarities that qephilim of the Court of Coin, the Free Battalion, and the Court of Sleep share. Few survivors of those other orders remain visible in Ardeyn, and those that are seen are sometimes mistaken for something else entirely. Such is the case for the Qephilim of Silence. According to common wisdom, monitors haven't been seen in over a century. The truth is, they have been seen, just not recognized.","Information Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere Health: 30 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Movement: Short Modifications: Stealth actions as level 8; perception as level 7. Combat: A monitor is always stealthy; even in broad daylight it can call upon its mythlight to darken the area around it and provide a shadow into which it can slip. If detected, a monitor prefers to evade an encounter rather than interacting or becoming embroiled in a conflict. Sometimes, though, what a monitor sees enrages it past its ability to remain an unprejudiced observer. When this happens, any creature within short distance must make an Intellect defense roll or be held in place for one round. This effect is the result of a psychic paralysis blast, which is not an action for the monitor. During the paralysis, the monitor slips away. Alternatively, the blast could allow a monitor a significant edge if it chooses to attack, since its horns automatically hit a held target and inflict an additional 2 points of damage. Once a creature is subject to the monitor's paralyzing psychic blast, a target can't be affected again for several hours. A monitor can modify its psychic blast to deal damage instead. When it does, it attacks up to two separate targets within close range as an action, dealing 3 points of Intellect damage to each (which ignores Armor). Interaction: Under normal circumstances, a monitor slips away if it realizes it has been noticed. Especially charismatic PCs might induce a monitor to take an action other than merely watching. (And there is a rumor of at least one monitor that has gone insane waiting for the Incarnation of Silence to return—this one, called Kamud, works as a bounty hunter.) Use: During a tense negotiation with a group of brigands, a sirrush, or another threat, one of the NPCs notices the shadow of a watching monitor. The NPC may leap to the assumption that the PCs are acting in bad faith and attack the characters, or the monitor, or both. Loot: Most monitors carry special equipment to watch with, and at least a few carry an artifact known as a monitor's monocle. Many also usually carry one or two cyphers with them.","Anywhere Health: 30 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Movement: Short Modifications: Stealth actions as level 8; perception as level 7.

MYRIAND VOLUNTEER,4,"Individuals who make up the force are not full-time myriands. They are shift workers who have a completely different personality and aspect when not patrolling. But when their shift comes up, an attached biological pod activates, transforming a regular person into a battle chrysalid.

MYRIAND VETERAN,6,"A myriand veteran has survived years of service, and in that time, has fully adapted to her chrysalid form.

A PC can attempt a new Intellect defense roll each round to break free of the effect. The effect is also broken if the myriand attacks the ""surrendered"" PC or one of her allies (both attacks of which hit automatically and inflict an additional 2 points of damage). Interaction: Veterans have more leeway when interacting with others, and they may even appear to engage in light banter, but they only do so as a means to an end when interrogating a witness or potential suspect.

NEZEREK,5,"The nezerek is a predator of the Strange. It roosts in lairs excavated in fundament, but spends most of its existence surfing the fractal currents hunting for new experiences. It looks almost like a lifelike component of the dark energy network until it adjusts its winglike surfaces to emerge from transit, revealing itself as something more dangerous than an elaborate design. A nezerek is a predatory beast nearly 30 feet (9 m) across from wing tip to wing tip, though its antennae can extend even farther. A nezerek isn't a planetovore, since it seems content to remain in the Strange, and its abilities are far less extreme. On the other hand, it is driven to discover new experiences and knowledge, and to gain that experience, it tends to assimilate anything new it comes into contact with, especially living creatures.","Knowledge, novelty Environment (the Strange): Anywhere Health: 36 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Movement: Short while flying Modifications: Attacks as level 6; speed defense as level 3 due to size. Combat: A nezerek uses its fractal antennae to attack up to two targets within long range on its turn, dealing 5 points of ambient damage to each target. The body of a PC struck by an antenna seems to ""fray"" at the edges, bleeding fractal material. About half the material is lost to the void, but about half is absorbed by the nezerek (which restores 2 points of its health). Given the length of a nezerek's antennae, a foe could choose to target them instead of the main body. An attack against an antenna is made as if against a level 6 target with 1 point of Armor and 10 health. If an antenna is destroyed, it takes the creature two rounds to regenerate a new one. If a nezerek is slain, it begins to ""fray"" like its victims, spraying fractal residue in every direction. All creatures within short range take 5 points of ambient damage from the deluge. Interaction: A nezerek is not automatically hostile, and it may simply soar past the PCs, despite obviously being aware of them. Any attempt at interaction on the PCs' part quickly changes this attitude of indifference to one of predation. Use: PCs traveling into the Strange for an extended period might notice a nezerek soaring in the distance. Loot: A nezerek's unraveled form contains 1d6 cyphers.","Anywhere Health: 36 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Movement: Short while flying Modifications: Attacks as level 6; speed defense as level 3 due to size.

FREE BATTALION MERCENARIES,3,"Qephilim of the Free Battalion serve as mercenaries across Ardeyn, often pledging themselves to causes that serve the goals of civilization and the preservation of Ardeyn as a repudiation of the Betrayal (when their ancestors served War). As a mercenary, a Free Battalion qephilim is often part of a company but could also be working alone guarding a caravan, watching a city gate, keeping a merchant's home safe from thieves, serving as a regular in a larger army, or working in a similar capacity. Unlike many mercenaries or even regular hired guards, Free Battalion mercs are more concerned with the underlying legality or morality of a particular duty asked of them. If a merc believes that his command is unjust, that command might be refused.","Righting wrongs Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere, usually in companies of two to eight Health: 9 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 2 Movement: Short Modifications: Perception as level 4. Combat: Qephilim of the Free Battalion usually attack with swords or bows. Military-minded, they know that outnumbering an enemy is often enough to defeat that enemy, and they are not adverse to calling in reinforcements. Interaction: A Free Battalion merc, unlike an average mercenary, feels beholden to his contract, even in the face of better offerings. Because of this loyalty, PCs will find it difficult to divert such a merc, and in fact, a merc will react badly if offered a bribe or sensing that a lie is being told. On the other hand, a merc without a contract might be willing to help a PC in return for all the standard conditions of engagement, including premium remuneration and paid funeral expenses. Use: Mercenaries of the Free Battalion are not an unfamiliar sight in Ardeyn. To the player characters, Free Battalion mercs are sometimes allies and sometimes obstacles. At times, a particular merc also rises to become a lieutenant or captain in larger standing armies, and these higher-ranking mercs lead groups of regular warriors (level 2 creatures). Loot: Any given Free Battalion merc has 1d6 crowns in addition to weapons, medium armor, and basic gear.","Almost anywhere, usually in companies of two to eight Health: 9 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 2 Movement: Short Modifications: Perception as level 4.

UMBER JUDGE,4,"An umber judge is a qephilim of the Court of Sleep responsible for judging souls in the Night Vault. An umber judge sometimes emerges into the Daylands or Borderlands, looking for agents of Lotan, rogue Court of Sleep necromancers, or straying spirits. Court of Sleep qephilim usually hide their features beneath robes, rune armor, and ornate helms. Some bear weights of balance, which they use to determine the amount of sin weighing a soul down.","Protect the souls of the dead; slay agents of Lotan Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere, either solo or in conclaves of up to three Health: 23 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Ardeyn lore as level 7. Combat: Umber judges know spells and often wield artifacts and other charms that can grant them both offensive and defensive abilities. Instead of attacking with mundane weapons, they use death spells, curses, and spirit whips. An umber judge can do one of the following: be borne aloft by a servitor spirit that grants the judge the ability to fly a short distance each round, gain +4 to Armor for ten minutes when a spirit wraps the umber judge like a cloak, or question the spirit of a recently slain creature to learn its secrets. Interaction: Umber judges are usually concerned only with their own duties and obligations, which means they tend to ignore the petitions of those whose aims do not match the judge's current desire. It's possible that a crafty negotiator could get the attention of a judge and convince it that their goals do align, bringing about a short-term alliance. The judge is likely to request the PCs' aid in something to test their sincerity before agreeing to anything. Use: Umber judges encountered outside the Night Vault are usually looking for clues regarding an escaped spirit, seeking a rogue necromancer, or running down the location of banned copies of any of the various Gospels of Lotan. An umber judge may seek out a PC to answer a question bearing on one of these issues, or accuse the PC of abetting the same.

QINOD TESTER,4,"This machine entity is a 5-foot-diamteter (2 m) mass of metal alloy manipulation cables surrounding an inner solid central core of electronic eyes that can see every known (and possibly every unknown) frequency of the spectrum. In addition to manipulation cables for fine work such as plucking flower petals, a qinod tester also has at least two stronger manipulators that can pluck the arms out of the sockets of more robust test subjects like metamorphosized battle chrysalides. Finally, the tester can extrude one or more beamed energy weapons and tranquilizer guns should subjects prove initially resistant to being dissected for study.","Unpredictable Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Almost anywhere in the Periphery or Veritex Health: 20 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 1 Movement: Immediate; short while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to interfering cable mass; all perception and tracking tasks as level 8. Combat: A Qinod tester can fire up to two beamed energy weapons at the same target or at two different targets within long range. Instead of firing a beam weapon for damage, a Qinod attacks with a tranquilizer flechette at a target within short range. A target who fails a Speed defense roll against the flechette takes 2 points of damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll or be paralyzed for up to one minute (the victim can attempt a Might-based roll each round to try to shake off the paralysis). The machine entity is extremely difficult to hide from, no matter the means used to evade its vision. Once a Qinod tester finds tracks or catches a scent, it usually tracks its next test subjects to their location. A Qinod tester carefully pulls apart dead or paralyzed victims if allowed the peace to do so, studying the results with great interest. Interaction: Qinod testers never speak, and they usually don't do what PCs expect. A Qinod tester is just as likely to ignore PCs as attack them, especially if already involved in another test or observation. Use: A tester is encountered in the Periphery while the PCs are on another task. Loot: One or two weaponlike artifacts could be salvaged from the remains of a tester.","Almost anywhere in the Periphery or Veritex Health: 20 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 1 Movement: Immediate; short while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to interfering cable mass; all perception and tracking tasks as level 8.

QINOD DECONSTRUCTOR,8,"A Qinod deconstructor shares many visual similarities with a tester but has a diameter of at least 20 feet (6 m). The larger size apparently comes with an appetite for power and destruction. Unlike a tester, a deconstructor seems mostly interested in wrecking, killing, and generally creating chaos.","Destruction Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Periphery of Ruk Health: 44 Damage Inflicted: 10 points Armor: 3 Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 7 due to size. Combat: The touch of an unfurled cable, which the deconstructor can stretch to attack up to three targets within short range, sucks bioelectric energy from living beings and mechanical constructs alike. Sometimes a deconstructor preferentially attacks a PC's equipment, such as a weapon, armor, or another object. If successfully attacked, objects of level 8 or less are destroyed, and the owner is subject to 3 points of damage from flying shrapnel. A deconstructor can fire one missile every hour at a target or location up to a mile away. When such a missile strikes, all creatures within short range of the impact take 15 points of damage (creatures caught in the blast who make a successful Speed defense roll suffer only 4 points of damage instead). A Qinod deconstructor regenerates 2 points of damage every round, but in a round where it drains a target of bioelectric energy, it regenerates 10 points of damage instead. If a deconstructor's health is reduced to 0, the creature collapses, and its regeneration falls to a rate of 2 points per minute, unless an effort is made to scatter its large components so they do not touch. Interaction: A deconstructor is indifferent to attempts to interact with it. Use: A trio of deconstructors has moved from destroying to building something in the center of a grey forest in the Periphery.

SARK,4,"Sark are the debased and graceless qephilim who lost their way during the Age of Myth, which is why they are also called the Lost Qephilim and the Eighth Kindred. Animalistic savages, sark are driven by hunger, lust, rage, and fear. Given how closely these drives mimic sins proscribed by the Incarnations, many believe that the sark are extensions of Lotan's evil manifest in the world. Sark could hardly be mistaken for qephilim, though they most resemble the Qephilim of War, if they were to forsake cleanliness, clothing not made from the hides and scalps of their victims, and any semblance of sanity. Sark live to prey on other creatures, and they inflict much cruelty and pain in the process. Despite their savage ways, they retain something of their qephilim roots, which means they can be clever, and they lay cunning traps.","Hunger, lust, rage, and fear Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Sark dwell in small groups of three to six, usually in wooded areas or rocky, mountainous regions of the Borderlands and Daylands; some packs also lair in the Night Vault Health: 17 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Stealth as level 5. Combat: Sark either claw or bite their prey, though some individuals may use weapons, especially heavy weapons, ranged weapons, and on the very rare occasion, artifacts. When clawing or biting, a sark can hold a victim in place instead of dealing damage on a successful attack. The held victim can attempt to escape (a Might-based roll) on its turn. Both the grappling sark and the grappled foe are easier targets for other combatants; the difficulty of attacks made against them is modified by two steps in the attacker's favor. Some sark retain a glimmer of their ancestral mythlight. Such sark can sometimes call on psychic abilities, targeting a victim at long range who fails an Intellect defense roll. On a successful attack, the victim stands frozen in horror for one round, overcome by a glimpse of the sark's savage mind and memories of the cruelties it has perpetrated. Interaction: Many sark have devolved so completely that they no longer speak the Maker's Tongue, and interacting with them is no different than interacting with beasts. The few who can speak might be swayed to do so if the rewards (food, usually) are significant enough. Use: The PCs, traveling through the wilderness, find a location—perhaps a cave or an old ruin—that seems like a safe shelter. The site is actually a lair of a sark pack. Loot: A pack may have 2d6 crowns, plus perhaps a cypher between them.

Combat: Shoggoths sprout tendrils and mouths, and they spread their wide, amorphous forms, allowing them to attack all foes within immediate range.

A sirrush's head bears a brilliant crest that it unfurls to impress lesser creatures into reverence.","Hungers for worship or other strong emotion Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Near medium and larger cities, either singly or as a pair Health: 28 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Deceives as level 6; Speed defense as level 4 due to size. Combat: When a sirrush raises its crest (an action), targets it selects within short range feel an overwhelming sense of awe, fear, or friendship—whichever the sirrush chooses—until the sirrush furls its crest again (another action). While a sirrush displays its feathered splendor, it can move only an immediate distance. PCs affected by the crest must make an Intellect roll to attempt to attack the sirrush. Failure means that the character cannot attack the creature this round, and defending against the sirrush becomes two steps more difficult the next time the sirrush attacks. The awe/fear/friend effect is a passive effect after the crest is unfurled, but the sirrush can choose to use its sorcerous crest more actively. In this case, the sirrush makes a psychic attack against a single character within long range, causing 4 points of Intellect damage (which ignores Armor) and stunning him for one round. If the sirrush has an artifact, it likely uses the item in combat. A sirrush can also physically attack with its claws and bite. Interaction: A sirrush that has some time to work its ""minor deity"" angle may actually come to believe in its own divinity. If the sirrush has been installed in a given location long enough, the temple or shrine it inhabits is likely also tended by priests, guards, and other functionaries who explain to PCs how they should interact with the god (respectfully and possibly bearing rich offerings). A sirrush that is worshiped as a god may prove helpful to PCs if they come to it with a question or petition, but if called out as a fake, it reacts violently. Use: The PCs visit a new location and are invited to give their respects at a nearby shrine where a deity sometimes manifests to answer questions and, in return, accept offerings.

SOULSHORN,8,"A human or qephilim that uses a specific necromantic sorcery to expunge its own soul without killing itself (that last bit is the most difficult part of the process) becomes a soulshorn. A soulshorn appears to be a living creature—it even breathes, eats, and sleeps—but it is considered an undead creature all the same, because one automatically reanimates after it dies, returned to perfect health every time. Many soulshorns have lived for hundreds of years, accumulating more and more powerful dire sorcery each year, increasing their mastery of ancient knowledge, secrets of prior ages, and offensive sorcery. Though powerful, soulshorns are not divine nor meant to live forever. The longer a soulshorn survives, the more erratic and outright insane it becomes. Many become megalomaniacal, which usually leads to their eventual downfall. Some become drooling idiots, with only occasional flashes of sorcerous power. Those that live the longest are the ones who retreat from normal society and find a lair in an ancient citadel, qephilim ruin, moon, or skerry along the Borderlands.","Unpredictable Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): A soulshorn's hidden lair could be almost anywhere. Health: 39 Damage Inflicted: 8 points Movement: Short; long while flying Combat: Most soulshorns can attack with bolts of flesh-decaying energy against single targets at long range, or emit a necrotic pulse that attacks all selected PCs within short range. Soulshorns can fly when they move, and they can remain invisible each round they spend their action concentrating on staying unseen. Individual soulshorns may have also learned unique spells that provide them with additional abilities. For instance, some soulshorns learn how to enslave powerful spirits or create golems. Finally, a soulshorn may also use a variety of cyphers and Ardeyn artifacts both offensively and defensively. Regardless of other abilities, all soulshorns can attempt to feed on a target creature's soul to empower themselves. When one does, it focuses on a foe it can see when it makes any kind of attack. Any damage inflicted on the selected foe by the soulshorn increases by 4 additional points of damage. The soulshorn restores the same number of points to its health. This attack sometimes allows the soulshorn to learn information about the target at the same time. If killed, a soulshorn returns to life and full health seven days after its death, unless its remains are burned in the interim. If its remains are burned, the soulshorn is truly dead. Interaction: Soulshorns attempt to keep their ""undead"" status secret, given the stigma of having given one's soul to Lotan. More important to most soulshorn is keeping their resurrecion power secret. A foe who does not burn a defeated soulshorn is a foe who propagates a helpful lie. Use: As the PCs break into what appears to be a vacant ancient qephilim tomb, they see disquieting symbols of necromancy painted on the floor and walls. If they press forward, a soulshorn (or its guardians) emerge to slay the intruders. Loot: The inner sanctum of a defeated soulshorn might contain 10d100 crowns, 1d6 + 3 cyphers, and at least one artifact.","A soulshorn's hidden lair could be almost anywhere.

SPIRIT OF WRATH,2,"When a spirit of a dead creature fails to find its way to the Night Vault, escapes the same, or is summoned forth by a necromancer, it may become a bodiless spirit of rage and loss: a spirit of wrath (commonly shortened to wrath). A wrath appears as a shadowy or misty figure that can resemble the humanoid figure it once was, though spirits of wrath tend to swarm together, making it difficult to distinguish them from each other. Wraths are often mindless, consumed by their condition. But on occasion, a wrath not too far gone still remembers its life and may respond to questions or seek to locate its loved ones or enemies. A wrath may even attempt to finish a task it started in life. But in time, even the strongest-willed spirit's mind erodes without physical substance to renew it, and it becomes an almost mindless monster of destruction.","Destruction Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere, singly or in groups of six to ten Health: 6 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short while flying Modifications: Stealth as level 5. Combat: A spirit of wrath can become fully insubstantial. After it does so, the creature can't change state again until its next turn. While insubstantial, it can't affect or be affected by anything (except for spiritslaying weapons and attacks), and it can pass through solid matter without hindrance, but even simple magical wards can keep it at bay. While partly insubstantial (its normal state), a wrath can affect and be affected by others normally. A wrath attacks with its touch, which rots flesh and drains life. A group of five wraths can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to make one attack roll as a single level 4 creature dealing 5 points of damage. Interaction: Most wraths moan and scream in rage. The rare few that retain reason can speak in a sepulchral voice, and they may even negotiate. Any alliance with a wrath is usually short-lived, since the creature eventually forgets itself and descends fully into rage and the desire to spread destruction. Use: The PCs are attacked while attending a burial, or they happen to pass close to or camp near a graveyard (or if in the Queendom, a section of the Path of the Dead). Even if all the wraths are slain, another swarm appears in the location within a week. Somewhere nearby, a necromancer is active.","Almost anywhere, singly or in groups of six to ten Health: 6 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short while flying Modifications: Stealth as level 5.

SPORE WORM,5,"As large as an adult human, the spore worm is a strange serpentine creature of kaleidoscope colors. It has no eyes, just a sphincterlike mouth and dozens of spiracles running its length through which it emits mind-affecting spores. Spore worms hunt in remote areas (including grey forests), using spores to overcome prey and then burrowing into their catch, eating it from the inside out.","Hungers for flesh Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Hunts alone in relatively desolate regions Health: 21 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Perception as level 4. Combat: In addition to its deadly bite, a spore worm can fill the immediate area around it with one of three different kinds of spores. Its spore clouds last only one round, but the worm can produce a new cloud each round without using an action. The three kinds of spores the worm can emit are: Hallucinogen: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll lose their next turn. Each round, a new defense roll is allowed, and failure means another lost turn. The effects do not end until a roll is successful. Fear: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll flee as quickly as they can until they are at least a long distance away from the worm. Attraction: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll move to stand next to the worm. On the following round, they can take no action, and the difficulty of defense rolls against the worm's bite attack is increased by two steps. Spore worms are blind, and thus they are immune to any visual effects. They are likewise immune to spores of any kind. Interaction: Spore worms are fairly intelligent, but they rarely have motives beyond simple hunger and survival. They do not speak, but a rare few have learned to understand a few words in various languages. They are almost impossible to train or even placate.

THONIK,3,"A thonik looks like a particularly dense area of chaotic fractal pattern undulating through the Strange. When it attacks, it's easier to distinguish as a separate entity. An aggressive thonik appears something like a ""sheet"" of flexible fundament, shot through with undulating mouthlike openings that appear, disappear, open, and close in rhythmic pulses. The thonik is a predator of the dark energy network, and it feeds primarily on background energy fields of the Strange, but it rarely passes up the concentrated energy associated with cyphers, artifacts, and the bodies of living creatures. Certain entities of the Strange can tame thoniks to docility with a touch. For instance, Chaosphere hierarchs have been known to wear thoniks as cloaks that self-animate and attack aggressors without any need for direction from the wearer.","Hungers for energy Environment (the Strange): Anywhere Health: 22 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Movement: Short Modifications: Attacks, initiative, and stealth as level 5 while in the Strange. Combat: A thonik attacks by attempting to wrap its sheetlike body around a target. On a successful attack, the thonik inflicts 5 points of damage, and the target must make a second Speed defense roll or become wrapped in the thonik's undulating body. On subsequent turns, a thonik can automatically deal 5 points of damage (that ignores Armor) to the wrapped foe. As another option, it could automatically absorb the energy of a cypher carried by the wrapped foe. Finally, it might choose to suck energy from an artifact carried by its prey; when it does so, it permanently doubles the artifact's chance of depletion. A successful attack against a thonik wrapped around prey splits the damage equally between both thonik and prey. On her turn, a wrapped target's only physical option is to attempt to break free as her action, which she does if she succeeds on a level 5 Might-based task. Interaction: Thoniks are about as intelligent as animal predators, which means that while they can't speak, they could be conditioned by a determined PC trainer to serve as defenders of a given territory, to avoid attacking certain individuals, and so on. Use: The PCs find the interface to a previously unknown recursion in the Strange. Guarding the interface, however, is a pack of thoniks.","Anywhere Health: 22 Damage Inflicted: 6 points Movement: Short Modifications: Attacks, initiative, and stealth as level 5 while in the Strange.

Finally, it might choose to suck energy from an artifact carried by its prey; when it does so, it permanently doubles the artifact's chance of depletion. A successful attack against a thonik wrapped around prey splits the damage equally between both thonik and prey. On her turn, a wrapped target's only physical option is to attempt to break free as her action, which she does if she succeeds on a level 5 Might-based task.","Thoniks are about as intelligent as animal predators, which means that while they can't speak, they could be conditioned by a determined PC trainer to serve as defenders of a given territory, to avoid attacking certain individuals, and so on.","The PCs find the interface to a previously unknown recursion in the Strange. Guarding the interface, however, is a pack of thoniks.",
UMBER WOLF,3,"Umber wolves should be feared as much by the living as by the dead, given their taste for souls, regardless of whether those souls are still inhabiting a living body. Umber wolves travel in packs that announce their presence with soul-shivering howls that echo through Night Vault tunnels, and, when Death's moon is full, across the plains of Ardeyn. An umber wolf doesn't actually look that much like a wolf—it more resembles the opaque shadow of a starved, demonic human moving on all fours, almost a cruel parody of a natural creature, with eyes like white fire.","Hungers for souls Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Umber wolves dwell in the Night Vault (and in tomb complexes), hunting in packs of six to ten; they range into the open during Death's full moon, which occurs every thirty-three days Health: 15 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short Modifications: Track as level 6. Combat: Umber wolves attack by biting, and their attacks are spiritslaying (which means they can attack both normal and insubstantial creatures without any penalties). A pack of umber wolves usually announces itself with terrifying howls before combat begins. If potential prey hears the howling and fails an Intellect defense roll, the umber wolves gain initiative in combat that begins within the next hour. If the victim succeeds at the Intellect roll, initiative is determined normally. When umber wolves attack as a pack, four to six can select a single victim and make one attack as if they were a level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage that ignores Armor, as the pack begins to pull the victim's soul free of its flesh. If a living creature (or animate spirit) is slain by an umber wolf, the spirit is destroyed for good, since the wolves consume the very soul of their prey. Interaction: Only members of the Court of Sleep have a hope of dealing peacefully with umber wolves. To all others, they are vicious, partly supernatural predators. Use: As Death's moon rises, a pack of umber wolves sets to howling, and by the sound of it, they're close and getting closer to the PCs.","Umber wolves dwell in the Night Vault (and in tomb complexes), hunting in packs of six to ten; they range into the open during Death's full moon, which occurs every thirty-three days Health: 15 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short Modifications: Track as level 6.

UTRICLE,5,"An utricle is a free-roaming digestive cyst that can grow up to 10 feet (3 m) or more in diameter. Its central body is a quivering knot of protoplasm fringed by three or four tentacles, as well as a carpet of microscopic cilia that grants the creature a surprising mobility for its bulk. The central bulge is translucent, and the creature's most recent meal can sometimes be seen floating within the spongy mass. An utricle is a bioengineered predator often deployed in out-of-the way locations by factions more concerned with security than the value of a Ruk life. Once an utricle is deployed, the creature doesn't distinguish master from prey—anything made of flesh is fair game to this creature made to eat. Possessing no skeleton or carapace, an utricle with nothing in its digestive cyst can squeeze through openings no larger than a few inches (5 cm) across, though doing so can take a few minutes.","Hungers for flesh Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere enclosed or in the Veritex Health: 33 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Hides in areas filled with cracks and crannies as level 6; Speed defense as level 4 due to size. Combat: The utricle can attack up to two targets with a single action. On a hit, a target is grabbed and pulled into the utricle's body by a process that is like osmosis, but much quicker. A normalsized utricle can hold up to four human-sized morsels of food at one time, but after it holds two or more creatures, it can move only an immediate distance. Engulfed targets take acid damage each round they remain caught (and would eventually begin to suffocate if the acid didn't digest them first). An engulfed target can attempt to squirm free with a successful Speed-based roll, or to damage the utricle cyst wall from the inside with melee attacks (the difficulty of attacks launched from within is increased by one step). The creature's gelatinous nature accounts for its Armor value. Interaction: An utricle responds to its surroundings like a bacteria seeking food; once it goes after something, killing it is usually the only way to stop an utricle. Use: Utricle attacks are usually random subterranean Veritex encounters. However, the creatures are also sometimes deployed in the Strange to serve as guardians for hidden caches, thanks to their ability to become dormant for years at a time in the absence of food, without apparent ill effect once they become active again. Loot: An utricle dissolves all flesh and soft organic material, leaving behind minerals and other nonorganics. As a result, an utricle body could contain bitwallets, a cypher or two, and other equipment.","Anywhere enclosed or in the Veritex Health: 33 Damage Inflicted: 5 points Armor: 1 Movement: Short Modifications: Hides in areas filled with cracks and crannies as level 6; Speed defense as level 4 due to size.

VARIOKARYON,4,"A body can take only so many grafts before it either shuts down or goes insane. When someone pushes that limit and survives, she has probably become a variokaryon—a graft addict. Using underworld contacts, the addict can purchase banned grafts that allow her to harvest biological matter from other creatures and directly incorporate that matter into herself. In this way, a variokaryon can add as many grafts to herself as she can get away with, and in fact must continue to do so. Without receiving regular hits of new biological material, a variokaryon goes into a painful and ultimately lethal withdrawal. A variokaryon tries to hide her condition from others and blend in as a regular citizen. That is, until she gets a prospective graft donor alone…","Hungers for body parts (especially faces) to use as grafts Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually in Harmonious or the Shadowed City Health: 23 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Movement: Short Modifications: Stealth and all attacks as level 5.

If the variokaryon's health reaches 0, the regeneration rate is reduced to 1 point of health per round, and if the variokaryon is dismembered or otherwise violently dispersed, regeneration stops completely. Any given variokaryon can also accomplish one or more of the following, depending on its particular graft mix: Thundering Scream: Creatures within immediate range of the variokaryon who fail a Might defense roll suffer 4 points of sonic damage that ignores Armor and are deafened for one minute. Stomach Shroud: The variokaryon vomits an external stomach (appearing as a multilayered white shroud). A target within immediate range who fails a Speed defense roll takes 6 points of acid damage every round until it can succeed at another Speed- or Might-based roll to break free of the billowing acidic shroud. Battle Bulk: The variokaryon gains +4 to Armor and +10 to health for one minute. Horrifying Attention: A variokaryon uses vestigial brain matter of harvested faces to launch a multifaceted attack on a foe within short range through the All Song.

SCLERID PATCH,4,"This creature appears as a growth of weeds emerging from the surface of a structure, the ground, a vehicle, or even from another living creature. These particular weeds look like a mass of writhing green tentacles, each reaching at least a foot in length, and sometimes stretching farther. Most of the time, sclerid patches go unnoticed, thanks to their ability to blend into their surroundings due to the chromatophores that cover their surface.","Spread Vaxt seeds Environment (the Strange): Anywhere Health: 12 Damage Inflicted: 4 points Armor: 1 Movement: None (except through seed dispersal) Modifications: Disguise and hiding tasks as level 6; Speed defense as level 2 due to fixed position.

After an encounter with a sclerid patch, each PC attacked by a sclerid or who was within immediate range of a sclerid that was damaged or destroyed must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the puffs of microscopic seeds that the plant released during the combat secretly root just beneath an infected PC's skin or in his lungs. Treat the colonization as a disease. A colonized creature doesn't notice any symptoms that hinder his abilities, but he might have a sore throat one day, a sniffly nose the next, and so on. On the third day of colonization, tendrils of the sclerid break to the surface and may become noticeable (though where they break through is not felt by the victim because of locally produced anesthetizing fluid and disguising chromatophores). At this point, killing the colonizing plant patch requires a procedure equivalent to a serious operation to avoid killing the host (rootlets have invaded most of the victim's organs). In addition, the visible tendrils fight back as a level 2 creature that uses the victim's health as its own, and it can attack other creatures within immediate range of the colonized victim for 3 points of damage. If left untreated, most sclerid victims hosting a colony die after about thirty days, when the rootlets finally cause a stroke or heart attack. Sometimes, though, a sclerid and its host attain a sort of symbiotic relationship that lasts indefinitely.

WINGED MONKEY,3,"Before they were enslaved, winged monkeys were a free and not particularly vicious people, though they were mischievous. That tendency led to their current long-term predicament as slaves of whoever is strong enough to hold an item called the golden cap, currently in the possession of one Wicked Witch. As slaves of the Wicked Witch, winged monkeys are horrors that can snatch travelers from the road, children from their beds, or ladies from their boudoirs. Sometimes victims are taken as captives, and other times they are dropped from a great height.","Serve the Wicked Witch Environment (Oz | Magic): Almost anywhere, in troops of five or more Health: 12 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness. Combat: A winged monkey inflicts damage with its claws or bite (though some winged monkeys have swords or other melee weapons that inflict 4 points of damage). A winged monkey can also make a ""flyby snatch"" attack if it's between short and long range of the target. The monkey yanks the target off her feet and pulls her 50 feet (15 m) into the air (or as high as overhead space allows). What happens next depends on the intentions of the winged monkey. It could drop the target at the end of its turn from a height of 50 feet (15 m), inflicting 5 points of damage. It could go for more altitude on its next turn and drop the victim from 150 feet (46 m), inflicting 15 points of damage. Or it could begin flying away, intent on taking the target captive. A target held in a winged monkey's grip can break free with a successful Might- or Speed-based roll, but of course it suffers the consequences of whatever drop lies beneath. Interaction: Winged monkeys can speak, but they usually remain silent. Even if they do speak, it is only to explain their intentions. They cannot do other than what they were commanded. Use: A troop of winged monkeys guards the default translation destination in the recursion of Oz, and it either kills intruders or brings them to the Wicked Witch.","Almost anywhere, in troops of five or more Health: 12 Damage Inflicted: 3 points Movement: Short; long while flying Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness.

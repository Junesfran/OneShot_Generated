BIOSPLICE COMPANION
Level: 1d6
Form (initial): An ampule filled with glowing
blue bioactive tissue
Effect: Several different biosplice companions
exist. To create a biosplice companion, a wouldbe master injects a biosplice ampule into her
body. Over the course of thirty-three hours,
the injection site swells up to the size of a
second head, then bursts, inflicting 3 points of
damage as the biosplice companion emerges.
Generally, a biosplice companion’s level is
equal to the artifact level. It is about half the
size of its master and has enough intelligence
to follow commands, but otherwise it operates
at the level of a companion. A depletion roll is
required each time a biosplice companion uses
its special ability.
The types of companions include (but are not
limited to) the following:
Defender: Has a single eye that crackles
with bioelectric energy. If a creature attacks
its master (or the companion), the defender
biosplice immediately fires a blast of electrical
energy that inflicts damage equal to the artifact
level on the attacker. It fires once per round for
as long as its master continues to be attacked.
Moves a short distance each round.
Aggressor: Very similar to a defender, except it
targets creatures indicated by its master.
Healer: Slithers an immediate distance each
round. If its master takes Might damage, the
biosplice companion bites him, injecting him
with tissue-repairing pharmaceuticals that heal a
number of points of damage equal to the artifact
level. It continues to apply its healing bite, once
per round, for as long as its master remains
damaged.
Messenger: Has a face resembling that of its
master and moves a long distance each round.
The messenger can find any location its master
has been to or could find, and deliver a short
message without requiring a depletion roll. If
desired, the messenger can mentally link to its
master, allowing its master to speak from the
mouth of the messenger and hear what the
messenger hears in return; each round of such
mental linkage requires a depletion roll.

COMMUNION PLATTER OF THE
///
TRUE CODE
Level: 1d6
Form: An ornate organimer platter with
covering lid
Effect: Up to six communion wafers (or any
small pieces of edible food) can be treated at
a time in a one-round process that involves
closing the platter’s covering lid and pressing
a contact. A treated communion wafer confers
the normal benefits of communion (if any)
and grants a temporary +3 bonus to Edge,
distributed across whatever Pools the character
desires. The bonus lasts for one hour.

ENIGMALITH
///
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A flat, palm-sized stone disc, which
can be “unfolded” to create a 6-foot-high (2 m)
monolith
Effect: An enigmalith can be unfolded over
the course of six actions, with each action
roughly doubling the mass of the object until
it has as much as a granite monolith of the
given dimensions would. (Folding reverses the
process.)
An enigmalith is a prison that stores its
inmates in abeyance. An unfolded enigmalith
may accidentally trap whoever opens it
or attempts to use it if the user fails an
Intellect defense roll. Newly trapped victims
go into abeyance, leaving an afterimage of
a stylized engraving of the victim on the
enigmalith’s surface. Touching an engraving
on an enigmalith frees the associated trapped
creature (unless whoever touches the
engraving is trapped in turn). Newly discovered
enigmaliths often contain random creatures
wholly unknown to modern Ruk (randomly
selected by the GM, up to the artifact’s level).
Newly released creatures are often dangerous,
confused, and difficult to communicate with.
A depletion roll is required each time a
creature is trapped or released. If the artifact is
depleted, all the creatures trapped within are
released.

METABOLISM BUD
///
Level: 1d6
Form: An organic pod, almost like a small,
hemispherical bit of brain; once grafted to a
host, the host’s flesh grows over it until it is
only a lump
Effect: The pod grafts onto any living
host (usually near the brain or spine) and
injects chemicals that boost the creature’s
metabolism. This permanently raises the host’s
Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.

PHEROMONE BANNER
///
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A wide strip of flexible material that
gives off a pungent scent
Effect: When activated, a banner emits a
pheromone that can affect all pre-treated allies
within short range that breathe in the odor.
Pre-treating an ally requires an action and
touch proximity. Unless noted otherwise, a
pheromone banner produces its effect for one
minute per activation.
01–10 Melee attacks of pre-treated allies
decrease in difficulty by one step
11–20 Ranged attacks of pre-treated allies
decrease in difficulty by one step
21–30 Melee attacks made by targets other
than a pre-treated ally increase in
difficulty by one step
31–40 Ranged attacks made by targets
 other than a pre-treated ally increase
 in difficulty by one step
41–50 Pre-treated allies feel less pain (and
 gain +1 to Armor)
51–60 Attempts to intimidate targets other
 than a pre-treated ally decrease in
 difficulty by one step
61–70 Pre-treated allies who make a
 recovery roll while banner is active
 recover an additional 4 points
71–80 Speed defense rolls of pre-treated
 allies decrease in difficulty by one
 step
81–90 Might defense rolls of pre-treated
 allies decrease in difficulty by one
 step
91–00 Intellect defense rolls of pre-treated
 allies decrease in difficulty by one
 step

RECURSION POD
///
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A bulb of living organic tissue the size
of a human head
Special: A recursion pod can move between
recursions.
Effect: When a recursion pod is placed on an
object (usually another artifact), the pod insinuates
veinlike tendrils into that object. This doesn’t
normally affect the object’s function. If the mated
object and recursion pod are translated into a
different recursion, though, not only does the pod
make it possible for the mated object to make the
transfer, but both the pod and mated object retain
their original forms as if having moved through an
inapposite gate. Any special properties possessed
by the mated object in its home recursion continue
to function at full capacity in the new recursion,
even if different laws are in operation. A depletion
roll is required each time the mated object
translates into a new recursion.

SKILL BUD
///
Level: 1d6
Form: An organic pod, almost like a small,
hemispherical bit of brain; once grafted to a host,
the host’s flesh grows over it until it is only a lump
Effect: This pod grafts onto any living
host (must be near the brain) and injects
complex chemicals that alter brain and muscle
functions. This grants the host training in one
(predetermined) skill.

///
TENDRIL GRAFT
///
Level: 1d6
Form: A whiplike length of organic material
similar to flesh
Effect: This graft attaches to the host’s spinal
column so that it can be controlled like a limb.
The host can use it like a whip (a light weapon)
even if his hands are full. He can also use it like a
prehensile tail that can hold his weight (assuming
he is roughly human-sized) or another object.

///
VENOM TROOPER COMMAND HELM
///
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A helmet that looks similar to the head
of a venom trooper, with a Zal faction symbol
emblazoned on the back
Effect: When worn by a creature and
activated, the wearer can take command of
a number of venom troopers (equal to the
artifact’s level) within long range. The wearer
must be able to see and hear the venom
troopers to be commanded, and vice versa. The
period of control lasts up to one hour.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

///
WEAPON GRAFT
///
Level: 1d6
Form: A medium weapon (melee or ranged),
with a sleeve of softer, fleshy material
Effect: This organic graft fits over a hand or
stump and affixes to the flesh of the host. The
physical bond provides an asset that makes
attacks one step easier. When a PC finds a
weapon graft, the GM determines what kind of
weapon is attached to the graft.

WINDRIDER
///
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: An 8-foot-long (2 m) organimer wing
Effect: This is a vehicle that can be ridden by
someone who makes Speed rolls (level 1) each
round. In combat, it moves a long distance
each round, but on extended trips, it can move
up to 80 miles (129 km) per hour. A depletion
roll is required for each hour of use.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100

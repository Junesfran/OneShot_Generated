 Bash (1 Might point): This is a pummeling
melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point
of damage than normal, but dazes your
target for one round, during which time the
difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified
by one step to its detriment. Action.


• Endurance: Any duration dealing with physical
actions is either doubled or halved, whichever
is better for you. For example, if the typical
person can hold their breath for thirty
seconds, you can hold it for one minute. If
the typical person can march for four hours
without stopping, you can do so for eight
hours. In terms of harmful effects, if a poison
paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are
paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum
duration is always one round. Enabler.


• Fleet of Foot: If you succeed at a difficulty
2 Speed roll to run, you can move a short
distance and take an action in the same
round. Enabler.


• No Need for Weapons: When you make an
unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), 
you can choose whether you make the attack
as if using a medium weapon or as if using a
light weapon. Enabler.


• Pierce (1 Speed point): This is a well-aimed,
penetrating ranged attack. You make an
attack and inflict 1 additional point of
damage. Action.


• Practiced in Armor: Vectors can wear armor
for long periods of time without tiring and
can compensate for slowed reactions from
wearing armor. You can wear any kind of
armor. You reduce the Might cost per hour
for wearing armor and the Speed Pool
reduction for wearing armor by 2. Enabler.

-- 2 --


• Enable Others: You can use the helping rules
to provide a benefit to another character
attempting a physical task. This requires no
action on your part. Enabler.


• Quick Recovery: Your second recovery roll
(usually requiring ten minutes) is only a
single action, just like the first roll. Enabler.


• Range Increase: Ranges for you increase by
one step. Immediate becomes short, short
becomes long, long becomes 200 feet (61
m). Enabler.


• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack
in which you are not already trained: light
bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium
bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged,
heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy
ranged. You are trained in attacks using that
type of weapon. Enabler.


• Spray (2 Speed points): If a weapon has the
ability to fire rapid shots without reloading
(usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as
the submachine gun), you can spray multiple
shots around your target to increase the
chance of hitting. Spray uses 1d6 + 1 rounds
of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon,
if it has less than the number rolled). The
difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one
step. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less
point of damage than normal. Action.


• Wreck: Using two hands, you wield a weapon
or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting
unarmed, this attack is made with both fists
or both feet together.) When using this as an
attack, you take a -1 penalty to the attack roll,
and you inflict 3 additional points of damage.
When attempting to damage an object or
barrier, you are trained in the task. Action.

-- 3 --

• Experienced With Armor: The cost reduction
from your Practiced in Armor ability improves.
You now reduce the Might cost per hour and
the Speed Pool reduction by 3. Enabler.


• Ignore the Pain: You do not feel the
detrimental effects of being impaired, and
when you are debilitated, you ignore those
effects and experience the effects normally
associated with being impaired instead.
(Dead is still dead.) Enabler.


• Lunge (2 Might points): This move requires
you to extend yourself for a powerful stab
or smash. The awkward lunge increases the
difficulty of the attack roll by one step. If your
attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional
points of damage. Action.


• Resilience: You have 1 point of Armor against
any kind of physical damage, even damage
that normally ignores Armor. Enabler.


• Slice (2 Speed points): This is a quick attack
with a bladed or pointed weapon that is hard
to defend against. The difficulty of the attack
roll is decreased by one step. If the attack is
successful, it deals 1 less point of damage
than normal. Action.


• Successive Attack: If you take down a foe,
you can immediately make another attack on
that same turn against a new foe within your
reach. The second attack is part of the same
action. You can use this move with melee
attacks and ranged attacks. Enabler.

-- 4 --

• Arc Spray (3 Speed points): If a weapon
has the ability to fire rapid shots without
reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon,
such as the automatic pistol), you can fire
your weapon at up to three targets (all next
to one another) as a single action. Make a
separate attack roll against each target. The
difficulty of each attack is increased by one
step. Action.


• Capable Warrior: Your attacks deal 1
additional point of damage. Enabler.


• Feint (2 Speed points): If you spend one
action creating a misdirection or diversion,
in the next round you can take advantage of
your opponent's lowered defenses. Make a melee attack roll against that opponent.
The difficulty of the roll is decreased by one
step. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4
additional points of damage. Action.


• Increased Effects: You treat rolls of natural 19
as rolls of natural 20 for either Might actions
or Speed actions (your choice when you gain
this ability). This allows you to gain a major
effect on a natural 19 or 20. Enabler.


• Runner: Your standard movement distance
becomes long. Enabler.


• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack
in which you are not already trained: light
bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium
bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged,
heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy
ranged. You are trained in attacks using that
type of weapon. Enabler.

-- 5 --

• Jump Attack (5 Might points): You attempt a
difficulty 4 Might action to jump high into
the air as part of your melee attack. If you
succeed, your attack inflicts 3 additional
points of damage and knocks the foe down.
If you fail, you still make your normal attack
roll, but you don't inflict the extra damage or
knock down the opponent. Action.


• Mastery With Defense: Choose one type of
defense task in which you are trained: Might,
Speed, or Intellect. You are specialized in
defense tasks of that type. Unlike most
moves, you can select this move up to three
times. Each time you select it, you must
choose a different type of defense task.
Enabler.


• Parry (5 Speed points): You can deflect
incoming attacks quickly. When you activate
this move, for the next ten rounds the
difficulty of all Speed defense rolls is reduced
by one step. Enabler.


• Physical Adept: Any time you spend points
from your Might Pool or Speed Pool on an 
action for any reason, if you roll a 1 on the
associated die, you reroll the die, always
taking the second result (even if it's a 1).
Enabler.


• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack,
even one in which you are already trained: light
bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium
bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged,
heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged.
You are trained in attacks using that type of
weapon. If you're already trained in that type
of attack, you instead become specialized in
that type of attack. Enabler.

-- 6 --

• Again and Again (8 Speed points): You can
take an additional action in a round in which
you have already acted. Enabler.


• Mastery With Armor: When you wear any
armor, you reduce the armor's penalties
(Might cost and Speed reduction) to 0. If
you select this move and you already have
the Experienced With Armor move, replace
Experienced With Armor with a different
third-tier move because Mastery With Armor
is better. Enabler.


• Spin Attack (5 Speed points): You stand still
and make melee attacks against up to five
foes within reach, all as part of the same
action in one round. Make a separate attack
roll for each foe. You remain limited by the
amount of Effort you can apply on one action.
Anything that modifies your attack or damage
applies to all of these attacks. Action.


• Shooting Gallery (5 Speed points): You stand
still and make ranged attacks against up to
five foes within range, all as part of the same
action in one round. Make a separate attack
roll for each foe. You remain limited by the
amount of Effort you can apply on one action.
Anything that modifies your attack or damage
applies to all of these attacks. Action.


• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack,
even one in which you are already trained:
light bashing, light bladed, light ranged,
medium bashing, medium bladed, medium
ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or
heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks
using that type of weapon. If you're already
trained in that type of attack, you instead are
specialized in that type of attack. Enabler.

Paradox
//
-- 1 --

• Closed Mind: You are trained in Intellect
defense tasks and have +2 to Armor against
damage that selectively targets your Intellect
Pool (that normally ignores Armor). Enabler.


• Exception (1 Intellect point): You pick one
creature within long range. The target is
jolted by a confluence of fundamental forces
for 4 points of damage.
If the target you select is not native to the
recursion where you attack it, its senses
are overwhelmed. On a successful attack,
in addition to taking 4 points of damage, it
cannot act on its next turn. Once exposed to
this revision, a non-native creature normally
can't be affected by the sense-overwhelming
portion of this attack again for several hours.
Action.


• Levitate Creature (2+ Intellect points): You
can temporarily bend the fundamental force
of gravity on a creature or object (no larger
than yourself) that is within long range. The
target's level can be no more than 2 above
your tier. On a successful attack, an affected
target floats an immediate distance over the
ground for one round. A levitating target
hovers just above the ground, able to take
actions, but unable to gain purchase through
physical contact.
Each round after the initial attack, you can
attempt to keep the target aloft by spending 1
additional Intellect point and succeeding at a
difficulty 2 Intellect task. If your concentration
lapses, the target drops back to the ground.
You can't directly move a levitating object
with this revision, but strong winds, a hearty
push by someone else, or other forces can
move the target. Action to initiate.


• Premonition (2 Intellect points): Despite
appearances, reality is quantum and noncausal,
which means a careful observer can discover
information leaks. You learn one random fact
from a person or location that is pertinent to
a topic you designate. Alternatively, you can
choose to learn a creature's level; however, if you
do so, you cannot learn anything else about it
later with this revision. Action.


• Shatter (2 Intellect points): You interrupt
the fundamental force holding normal
matter together for a moment, creating the
detonation of an object you choose within
long range. The object must be a small,
mundane item composed of homogeneous 
matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a
stone, and so on). The object explodes in an
immediate radius, attacking all creatures and
objects in the area for 1 point of damage.
Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to
increase your damage works differently than
it does for single-target attacks: for each level
of Effort applied to increase the damage,
add 2 points of damage to each target. If you
increase the damage through Effort, even if
you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area
still take 1 point of damage. Action.

-- 2 --

• Force Shield (2+ Intellect points): You call up
a field of shielding energy that grants you +1
to Armor for ten minutes. You can increase
the Armor bonus by spending Effort. Each
additional level of Effort increases the Armor
value you gain by 1. Action.

• Gate Key (4 Intellect points): You can secure
(or unlock) a regular door or other object
that can be closed or opened, such as a
drawer, laptop, satchel, book, window, and
so on, even if it can't normally be locked.
You can also lock (or open) a permanent or
semipermanent recursion gate, including
translation gates and inapposite gates. To
unlock or lock the target, you must touch it.
If the object is locked and you wish to unlock it,
succeed at an Intellect task with a difficulty
set by the GM (usually equal to the level of
the lock or effect holding the object closed).
On a success, the target is unlocked.
You automatically succeed in locking an object
if that is your goal; an object or gate is locked
at a level equal to 4 + your tier. Action.


• Mind Reading (4 Intellect points): You can read
the mind of a creature you can see within
short range. You gain access to its surface
thoughts for up to one minute as long as it is
within range. Action to initiate.


• Plasma Arc (2 Intellect points): You induce an
ionized arc of plasma to leap between two
targets that you can see and that are within
short range of each other. Both targets must
also be within long range of you. You roll
an attack for each target separately. If you
successfully attack only one target, it takes 4
points of damage from the intense heat. If you
successfully attack both targets, each takes 4
points of damage. Effort applied to one attack
counts for both, but you must abide by your
Effort level limit for each action. Action.


• Revise Flesh (3 Intellect points): You can revise
flesh with your touch in one of two ways.
When you touch an impaired or debilitated
character, you can choose to move the
character up one step on the damage track
(for example, a debilitated PC becomes
impaired, while an impaired creature becomes
hale). Alternatively, you can grant a character
a +2 bonus to his recovery roll if you use this
ability on the PC during a rest. Action.


-- 3 --

• Energy Protection (3+ Intellect points):
Choose a discrete type of energy that you
have experience with (such as heat, sonic,
electricity, and so on). You must be familiar
with the type of energy; for example, if you
have no experience with a certain kind of
extradimensional energy, you can't protect
against it. You gain +10 to Armor against
damage from that type of energy for ten
minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor
against damage from that energy for one day.
Instead of applying Effort to decrease the
difficulty of this revision, you can apply Effort
to protect more targets, with each level of
Effort affecting up to two additional targets.
You must touch additional targets to protect
them. Action to initiate.


• Eye for the Strange: You see a "shimmer"
around creatures and objects that are not
native to the current recursion and around
native creatures that possess the spark. If
you spend an action concentrating on a nonnative target with such a shimmer, you can
see the form it originally possessed prior to
translating to the current recursion (if it went
through an inapposite gate, it retains the
shimmer, but may not look much different).
Enabler (although you can use an Action to
enhance, as stated).


• Force at Distance (4+ Intellect points): You
temporarily bend the fundamental law of
gravity around a creature or object (up to
twice your mass) within short range. The
target's level can be no more than 2 above
your tier.
On a successful attack, an affected target is
caught in your telekinetic grip, and you can
move the creature up to a short distance in any
direction each round that you retain your hold.
A creature in your telekinetic grip can take
actions, but it can't move under its own
power. Each round after the initial attack, you
can attempt to keep your grip on the target by spending 2 additional Intellect points and
succeeding at a difficulty 2 Intellect task. If
your concentration lapses, the target drops
back to the ground.
Instead of applying Effort to decrease the
difficulty, you can apply Effort to increase the
amount of mass you can affect. Each level of
Effort allows you to affect a creature or object
twice as massive as before. For example,
applying one level of Effort would affect a
creature four times as massive as you, two
levels of Effort would affect a creature eight
times as massive, three levels can affect a
creature sixteen times as massive, and so on.
Action to initiate.


• Psychic Precision: You are trained in any
mental revision or mental ability that comes
from a cypher, an artifact, or your focus. For
example, you are trained when using Mind
Reading because it's a mental ability, but not
when using Plasma Arc. Enabler.


• Recursion Viewing (5 Intellect points): An
observer with the ability to revise reality
knows that space and distance is an illusion.
You concentrate to create an invisible,
immobile sensor at a location within a
recursion you have previously visited or
viewed (at the GM's discretion, you may have
to succeed at an Intellect task if the location
is somehow warded). The sensor lasts for
about an hour. Once it is created, you can
concentrate to see, hear, and smell through
the sensor whether you are somewhere else
in the recursion or on a connected prime.
The sensor doesn't grant you sensory
capabilities beyond the norm. Creating such
a sensor on the prime world of Earth requires
that you spend a level of Effort. Action to
create; action to check.

-- 4 --

• Gate Exit (9 Intellect points): You create one
end of a translation gate. The gate exit does
not connect to anything unless you earlier
created a different gate exit within another
recursion, in which case that exit and the
new one connect, creating a translation
gate. Unconnected gate exits last for about a month or until destroyed. After two gate
exits link up to form a translation gate, the
gate lasts for about a year or until destroyed.
(Like all objects, translation gates have levels
that speak to their ability to withstand harm.
The translation gate exit you create with this
ability is level 5.)
 You can create a permanent translation gate by
using this revision every day for seven days
on either exit of a connected translation gate.
One hour to initiate.


• Invisibility (4 Intellect points): You bend
light around you, becoming invisible for ten
minutes. While invisible, you are specialized
in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This
effect ends if you do something to reveal your
presence or position-attacking, performing
a revision, using an ability, moving a large
object, and so on. If this occurs, you can
regain the remaining invisibility effect by
taking an action to focus on hiding your
position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.


• Mind Control (6+ Intellect points): You control
the actions of another creature you touch.
This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target
must be level 2 or lower. After you have
established control, you maintain mental
contact with the target and sense what
it senses. You can allow it to act freely or
override its control on a case-by-case basis.
Instead of applying Effort to decrease the
difficulty, you can apply Effort to increase the
maximum level of the target. Thus, to control
the mind of a level 5 target (three levels
above the normal limit), you must apply
three levels of Effort. When the Mind Control
revision ends, the creature doesn't remember
being controlled or anything it did while
under your command. Action to initiate.


• Rapid Processing (6 Intellect points): You
or a target you touch experiences a higher
level of mental and physical reaction time
for about a minute. During that period, the
target modifies all Speed tasks by one step to
its benefit, including Speed defense rolls. In
addition, the target can take one extra action
at any time before the revision's duration
expires. Action.


• Warp World (5 Intellect points): You tug on the
fundamental laws of the recursion to create
a zone of distraction and confusion around
a creature you can see within long range for
one minute. All attacks against the target
are modified by one step to the attacker's
benefit, and all attacks made by the target
are modified by one step to its detriment.
If the target attempts an attack and fails, it
automatically hits one of the target's allies if
an ally is in range of that attack.

-- 5 --

• Draw From Fiction (7 Intellect points): You
produce, as if from thin air, a level 5 creature
of a kind you have previously encountered
in a recursion that you have visited. The
creature you name appears through a
transitory inapposite gate and remains for
one minute. The creature is drawn back to
its home recursion when the revision ends.
The creature acts as you direct. It appears
through an inapposite gate, and at the GM's
discretion, it may face difficulties according
to the rules of the location you draw it into,
such as suffering a step penalty to some or
all tasks it attempts. As a level 5 creature, it
has a target number of 15 and a health of 15,
and it inflicts 5 points of damage. Action.


• Exile (7 Intellect points): You send another
creature you can see within long range to
the recursion of its origin or (if the creature
is not native to a recursion) to one you've
previously visited. The target must be level 5
or lower, and you must succeed on an attack.
If successful, the creature is exiled through
a transitory inapposite gate. If the creature
resists, all its actions are modified by two
steps to its detriment for one minute.
 Exiled creatures can't return to the recursion
you exiled them from under their own power
for seven days (even if they have the ability
to move between recursions or if they find a
gate). Action.


• Force Focus (6 Intellect points + 2 Might
points): You exchange your current focus
for the focus you possessed in an alternate
recursion (or connected prime) for up to one
hour. Doing so is a transgression of reality
and the rules of translation, which means
that it saps both your Intellect Pool and
your Might Pool. While you retain the forced
focus, your appearance is a hybrid of your
current appearance and what you look like in
the recursion or prime whose focus you are 
borrowing. You can use your current focus
while the forced focus is active. Action to
initiate.


• Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points):
Tapping into the immense processing
capacity of the Strange, you ask the GM one
question and get a general answer. The GM
assigns a level to the question, so the more
obscure the answer, the more difficult the
task. Generally, knowledge that you could
find by looking somewhere other than your
current location is level 1, and obscure
knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining
knowledge of the future is impossible.
Action.


• True Senses: You can see in complete
darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it
were dim light. You recognize holograms,
disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry,
and other such tricks (for all senses) for what
they are. Enabler.

-- 6 --

• Drag Through Hell (9 Intellect Points): You send
a creature within immediate range that you
can see into one of a number of recursions
filled with brimstone, hellfire, and demons.
On a successful attack on a target of up to
level 7, the target is pulled through a transitory
inapposite gate and takes 6 points of damage
as it is dragged through the hellish recursion
behind some unspeakable monstrosity. If you
concentrate, you can attempt to keep the target
translocated with a new action and a new attack
roll each round. Each round the target remains
translocated, it suffers another 6 points of
damage. If the target returns before dying (or
if the initial attack wasn't successful at pulling
the target into a hellish recursion), all tasks the
target attempts on its next turn are modified by
two steps to its detriment. Action.


• Force Unification (13 Intellect points): You
briefly align the fundamental forces of
existence, creating a point where they merge
into a single interaction at a location you can
see. This allows you to briefly rewrite one
rule of the recursion where you are currently
located. The effect can be dramatic, but it
is always local and lasts anywhere from one
round to a minute, depending on the nature
of the change. Possibilities include changing
the color of the sky, causing an eclipse,
halving (or doubling) gravity, changing the
speed of light, and similar effects. The GM
will decide if your brief annotation of the laws
of existence is reasonable, how long it will
last, and what level of difficulty is needed to
achieve it. Action.


• Index Recursion (7 Intellect Points): You feel
a mental tug toward the nearest recursion
gate that you don't already know about.
You discern the location of and distance to
that gate (translation or inapposite), and
you learn enough information regarding the
general nature and theme of the recursion
it connects with to enter it directly using
Translation. Action.


• Master Translation (5+ Intellect points): When
you initiate a translation, you can choose to
also hasten and/or ease it. To do so, expend
the Intellect cost to trigger this revision as
you begin the translation trance. Then you
can apply one level of Effort to ease or hasten
the translation (instead of applying Effort to
decrease the difficulty), or two levels of Effort
to both ease and hasten the translation. You
must know that the recursion exists; the GM
will decide if you have enough information
to confirm its existence and determine what
level of difficulty is needed to reach the
destination. Action to initiate.


• Usurp Cypher: Choose one cypher that you
carry. The cypher must have an effect that is
not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher
and gain its power, which functions for
you continuously. You can choose a cypher
when you gain this ability, or you can wait
and make the choice later. After you usurp a
cypher's power, you cannot later switch to a
different cypher-the ability works only once.
Action to initiate.

Spinner

• Enthrall (1 Intellect point): While talking, you
grab and keep another creature's attention,
even if the creature can't understand you.
For as long as you do nothing but speak (you
can't even move), the other creature takes no
actions other than to defend itself, even over
multiple rounds. If the creature is attacked,
the effect ends. Action.


• Fast Talk (1 Intellect point): When speaking
with an intelligent creature who can
understand you and isn't hostile, you
convince that creature to take one reasonable
action on the next round. A reasonable action
must be agreed upon by the GM; it should
not put the creature or its allies in obvious
danger or be wildly out of character. Action.


• Sleight of Hand (1 Speed point): You can
perform small but seemingly impossible
tricks. For example, you can make a small
object in your hands disappear and move into a desired spot within reach (like your
pocket). You can make someone believe that
he has something in his possession that he
does not have (or vice versa). You can switch
similar objects right in front of someone's
eyes. Action.


• Spin Encouragement (1 Intellect point): While
you maintain this twist through ongoing
inspiring oration, your allies within short
range modify the difficulty of one of the
following task types (your choice) by one step
to their benefit: defense tasks, attack tasks, or
tasks related to any skill that you are trained
or specialized in. Action.


• Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points): You
convince all intelligent creatures who can
see, hear, and understand you that you are
someone or something other than who
you actually are. You don't impersonate
a specific individual known to the victim.
Instead, you convince the victim that you are
someone they do not know belonging to a
certain category of people. "We're from the
government." "I'm just a simple farmer from
the next town over." "Your commander sent
me." A disguise isn't necessary, but a good
disguise will almost certainly be an asset to
the roll involved. If you attempt to convince
more than one creature, the Intellect cost
increases by 1 point per additional victim.
Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour,
unless your actions or other circumstances
reveal your true identity earlier. Action.


• Understanding (2 Intellect points): You
observe or study a creature or object. Then,
the next time you interact with that creature
or object, the difficulty of the related task is
reduced by one step. Action.

-- 2 --

• Babel: After hearing a language spoken for
a few minutes, you can speak it and make
yourself understood. If you continue to use
the language to interact with native speakers,
your skills improve rapidly, to the point where
you might be mistaken for a native speaker
after just a few hours of speaking the new
language. Enabler.


• Efficiency (2 Intellect points): You can make
a weak rope last longer, coax more speed
from a motorcycle, improve the clarity of a
camera, jury-rig a light to be brighter, speed
up an Internet connection, and so on. You
increase an object's level by 2 for one minute,
or treat the object as an asset that reduces an
associated task's difficulty by two steps for
one minute (your choice). Action to initiate.


• Escape (2 Speed points): You slip your
restraints, squeeze through the bars, break
the grip of a creature holding you, pull free
from sucking quicksand, or otherwise get
loose from that which is holding you in place.
Action.


• Hand to Eye (2 Speed points): This twist
provides an asset to any tasks involving
manual dexterity, such as pickpocketing,
lockpicking, games involving agility, and so
on. Each use lasts up to a minute; multiple
uses replace the previous use. Action to
initiate.


• Pierce (1 Speed point): This is a well-aimed,
penetrating ranged attack. You make an
attack and inflict 1 additional point of
damage. Action.


• Spin Ideal (3 Intellect points): After interacting
with another creature who can hear and
understand you for at least one minute, you
can use a twist to attempt to temporarily
impart an ideal to the target that you can't
otherwise convince it of.
An ideal is different than a specific suggestion
or command; an ideal is an overarching value
such as, "all life is sacred," "my political
party is the best," "children should be seen,
not heard," and so on. An ideal influences a
creature's behavior but doesn't control it.
The imparted ideal lasts for as long as befits
the situation, but usually at least a few
hours. The implanted ideal is jeopardized if
someone friendly to the creature spends a
minute or more bringing the target back to
its senses. Action.

-- 3 --

• Blend In (4 Intellect points): When you
Blend In, creatures still see you, but they
attach no importance to your presence for
about a minute. While blending in, you are
specialized in stealth and Speed defense
tasks. This effect ends if you do something to
reveal your presence or position-attacking,
performing a twist, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the
remaining period of effect by taking an action
to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you
belong. Action to initiate or reinitiate.

• Grand Deception (3 Intellect points): You
convince an intelligent creature that can
understand you and isn't hostile of something
that is wildly and obviously untrue. Action.

• Mind Reading (4 Intellect points): You can read
the surface thoughts of a creature within short
range, even if the subject doesn't want you
to. You must be able to see the target. Once
you have established contact, you can read
the target's thoughts for up to one minute.
If you or the target moves out of range, the
connection is broken. Action to initiate.

• Oratory (4 Intellect points): When speaking
with a group of intelligent creatures that
can understand you and aren't hostile, you
convince them to take one reasonable action
on the next round. A reasonable action must
be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put
the creature or its allies in obvious danger or
be wildly out of character. Action.

• Spray (2 Speed points): If a weapon has the
ability to fire rapid shots without reloading
(usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such
as the automatic pistol), you can spray
multiple shots around your target to increase
the chance of hitting. This move uses 1d6
+ 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in
the weapon, if it has less than the number
rolled). The difficulty of the attack roll is
decreased by one step. If the attack is
successful, it deals 1 less point of damage
than normal. Action.

• Telling (2 Intellect points): This twist provides
an asset to any tasks attempting to deceive,
persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts up
to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks)
replaces the previous use. Action to initiate.

• Anticipate Attack (4 Intellect points): You can
sense when and how creatures attacking you
will make their attacks. The difficulty of Speed
defense rolls are reduced by one step for one
minute. Action.

• Feint (2 Speed points): If you spend one
action creating a misdirection or diversion,
in the next round you can take advantage of
your opponent's lowered defenses. Make
a melee attack roll against that opponent.
The difficulty of the roll is decreased by one
step. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4
additional points of damage. Action.

• Quick Wits: When performing a task that
would normally require spending points from
your Intellect Pool, you can spend points
from your Speed Pool instead. Enabler.

• Read the Signs (4 Intellect points): You examine
an area and learn precise, useful details about
the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up
to four questions about the immediate area,
but each requires its own roll. Action.

• Suggestion (4 Intellect points): You suggest an
action to another creature within immediate
range. If the action doesn't seem completely
at odds with the creature's nature, the
creature follows your suggestion. The
creature must be a level 2 or lower. The effect
of your suggestion lasts for up to a minute.
Instead of applying a level of Effort to decrease
the difficulty, you can apply it to increase the
maximum level of the target you can affect by
1. When you use this twist, you immediately
learn the creature's level (if you didn't already
know it). If its level is higher than 2, you can
immediately apply levels of Effort to increase
the maximum level allowed (up to that
creature's level).
When the effects of the twist end, the creature
remembers following the suggestion, but
believes that it chose to do so willingly.
Action to initiate.

• Arc Spray (3 Speed points): If a weapon
has the ability to fire rapid shots without
reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon,
such as the automatic pistol), you can fire
your weapon at up to three targets (all next
to one another) as a single action. Make a
separate attack roll against each target. The
difficulty of each attack is increased by one
step. Action.

• Energy Protection (4+ Intellect points):
Choose a discrete type of energy that you
have experience with (such as heat, sonic,
electricity, and so on). You must be familiar
with the type of energy; for example, if you
have no experience with a certain kind of
extradimensional energy, you can't protect
against it. You gain +10 to Armor against
damage from that type of energy for ten
minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor
against damage from that energy for one day.
Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty,
you can apply Effort to protect more targets, with
each level of Effort affecting up to two additional
targets. You must touch additional targets to
protect them. Action to initiate.

• Jury-Rig (5 Intellect points): You quickly
create an object using what would seem
to be entirely inappropriate materials.
You can make a bomb out of a tin can
and some household cleaners, a lockpick
out of aluminum foil, or a sword out of
broken furniture. The level of the item
determines the difficulty of the task, but the
appropriateness of the materials modifies it
as well. Generally, the object can be no larger
than something you can hold in one hand,
and it functions once (or in the case of a
weapon or similar item, is essentially useful
for one encounter). If you spend at least ten
minutes on the task, you can make up to
a level 5 item. You can't change the nature
of the materials involved. You can't take
iron rods and make a pile of gold coins or a
wicker basket, for example. Action.

• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack
in which you are not already trained: light
bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium
bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged,
heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy
ranged. You are trained in attacks using that
type of weapon. Enabler.

• Battle Management (4 Intellect points): As
long as you spend your action each round
giving orders or advice, the difficulty of attack
and defense actions by your allies within
short range is decreased by one step. Action.

• Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack,
even one in which you are already trained:
light bashing, light bladed, light ranged,
medium bashing, medium bladed, medium
ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or
heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks
using that type of weapon. If
you're already trained in
that type of attack, you
become specialized in
that type of attack.
Enabler.

• True Senses: You can see in complete
darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it
were dim light. You recognize holograms,
disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry,
and other such tricks (for all senses) for what
they are. Enabler.

• Word of Command (6 Intellect points + level
6 cypher): You utter a word so powerful that
to fully empower it, you sacrifice a level 6 or
higher cypher in your possession. You issue
your Word of Command to one creature
within long range that you can see. It does
not have to hear you to be affected. Targets
native to Earth are affected if you succeed on
an Intellect attack to persuade. Targets native
to a recursion or the Strange (including
planetovores) are automatically affected.
Affected targets must obey the command for
several hours before they're free to act as they
wish. Targets that are attacked while under the
effect of your command can defend themselves.
Typical commands include "Retreat," "Calm,"
"Come," and "Stay." The GM decides how the
target acts once a command is given. Action.

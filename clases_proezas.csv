1,Endurance,"Any duration dealing with physical actions is either doubled or halved, whichever is better for you. For example, if the typical person can hold their breath for thirty seconds, you can hold it for one minute. If the typical person can march for four hours without stopping, you can do so for eight hours. In terms of harmful effects, if a poison paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum duration is always one round. Enabler.",,1,1,Vector

5,Practiced in Armor,Vectors can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Might cost per hour for wearing armor and the Speed Pool reduction for wearing armor by 2. Enabler.,,1,1,Vector
6,Enable Others,You can use the helping rules to provide a benefit to another character attempting a physical task. This requires no action on your part. Enabler.,,2,1,Vector
7,Quick Recovery,"Your second recovery roll (usually requiring ten minutes) is only a single action, just like the first roll. Enabler.",,2,1,Vector

10,Spray,"If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as the submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. Spray uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). The difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one step. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. Action.",2 Speed points,2,1,Vector
11,Wreck,"Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a -1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task.

34,Closed Mind,You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and have +2 to Armor against damage that selectively targets your Intellect Pool (that normally ignores Armor). Enabler.,,1,1,Paradox
35,Exception,"You pick one creature within long range. The target is jolted by a confluence of fundamental forces for 4 points of damage. If the target you select is not native to the recursion where you attack it, its senses are overwhelmed. On a successful attack, in addition to taking 4 points of damage, it cannot act on its next turn. Once exposed to this revision, a non-native creature normally can't be affected by the sense-overwhelming portion of this attack again for several hours. Action.",1 Intellect point,1,1,Paradox
36,Levitate Creature,"You can temporarily bend the fundamental force of gravity on a creature or object (no larger than yourself) that is within long range. The target's level can be no more than 2 above your tier. On a successful attack, an affected target floats an immediate distance over the ground for one round. A levitating target hovers just above the ground, able to take actions, but unable to gain purchase through physical contact. Each round after the initial attack, you can attempt to keep the target aloft by spending 1 additional Intellect point and succeeding at a difficulty 2 Intellect task. If your concentration lapses, the target drops back to the ground. You can't directly move a levitating object with this revision, but strong winds, a hearty push by someone else, or other forces can move the target. Action to initiate.",2+ Intellect points,1,1,Paradox
37,Premonition,"Despite appearances, reality is quantum and noncausal, which means a careful observer can discover information leaks. You learn one random fact from a person or location that is pertinent to a topic you designate. Alternatively, you can choose to learn a creature's level; however, if you do so, you cannot learn anything else about it later with this revision. Action.",2 Intellect points,1,1,Paradox
38,Shatter,"You interrupt the fundamental force holding normal matter together for a moment, creating the detonation of an object you choose within long range. The object must be a small, mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius, attacking all creatures and objects in the area for 1 point of damage. Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks: for each level of Effort applied to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage to each target. If you increase the damage through Effort, even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.",2 Intellect points,1,1,Paradox
39,Force Shield,You call up a field of shielding energy that grants you +1 to Armor for ten minutes. You can increase the Armor bonus by spending Effort. Each additional level of Effort increases the Armor value you gain by 1. Action.,2+ Intellect points,2,1,Paradox
40,Gate Key,"You can secure (or unlock) a regular door or other object that can be closed or opened, such as a drawer, laptop, satchel, book, window, and so on, even if it can't normally be locked. You can also lock (or open) a permanent or semipermanent recursion gate, including translation gates and inapposite gates. To unlock or lock the target, you must touch it. If the object is locked and you wish to unlock it, succeed at an Intellect task with a difficulty set by the GM (usually equal to the level of the lock or effect holding the object closed). On a success, the target is unlocked. You automatically succeed in locking an object if that is your goal; an object or gate is locked at a level equal to 4 + your tier. Action.",4 Intellect points,2,1,Paradox
41,Mind Reading,You can read the mind of a creature you can see within short range. You gain access to its surface thoughts for up to one minute as long as it is within range. Action to initiate.,4 Intellect points,2,1,Paradox
42,Plasma Arc,"You induce an ionized arc of plasma to leap between two targets that you can see and that are within short range of each other. Both targets must also be within long range of you. You roll an attack for each target separately. If you successfully attack only one target, it takes 4 points of damage from the intense heat. If you successfully attack both targets, each takes 4 points of damage. Effort applied to one attack counts for both, but you must abide by your Effort level limit for each action. Action.",2 Intellect points,2,1,Paradox
43,Revise Flesh,"You can revise flesh with your touch in one of two ways. When you touch an impaired or debilitated character, you can choose to move the character up one step on the damage track (for example, a debilitated PC becomes impaired, while an impaired creature becomes hale). Alternatively, you can grant a character a +2 bonus to his recovery roll if you use this ability on the PC during a rest. Action.",3 Intellect points,2,1,Paradox
44,Energy Protection,"Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it. You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy for one day. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty of this revision, you can apply Effort to protect more targets, with each level of Effort affecting up to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect them. Action to initiate.",3+ Intellect points,3,1,Paradox
45,Eye for the Strange,"You see a ""shimmer"" around creatures and objects that are not native to the current recursion and around native creatures that possess the spark. If you spend an action concentrating on a nonnative target with such a shimmer, you can see the form it originally possessed prior to translating to the current recursion (if it went through an inapposite gate, it retains the shimmer, but may not look much different). Enabler (although you can use an Action to enhance, as stated).",,3,1,Paradox
46,Force at Distance,"You temporarily bend the fundamental law of gravity around a creature or object (up to twice your mass) within short range. The target's level can be no more than 2 above your tier. On a successful attack, an affected target is caught in your telekinetic grip, and you can move the creature up to a short distance in any direction each round that you retain your hold. A creature in your telekinetic grip can take actions, but it can't move under its own power. Each round after the initial attack, you can attempt to keep your grip on the target by spending 2 additional Intellect points and succeeding at a difficulty 2 Intellect task. If your concentration lapses, the target drops back to the ground. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply Effort to increase the amount of mass you can affect. Each level of Effort allows you to affect a creature or object twice as massive as before. For example, applying one level of Effort would affect a creature four times as massive as you, two levels of Effort would affect a creature eight times as massive, three levels can affect a creature sixteen times as massive, and so on. Action to initiate.",4+ Intellect points,3,1,Paradox
47,Psychic Precision,"You are trained in any mental revision or mental ability that comes from a cypher, an artifact, or your focus. For example, you are trained when using Mind Reading because it's a mental ability, but not when using Plasma Arc. Enabler.",,3,1,Paradox
48,Recursion Viewing,"An observer with the ability to revise reality knows that space and distance is an illusion. You concentrate to create an invisible, immobile sensor at a location within a recursion you have previously visited or viewed (at the GM's discretion, you may have to succeed at an Intellect task if the location is somehow warded). The sensor lasts for about an hour. Once it is created, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the sensor whether you are somewhere else in the recursion or on a connected prime. The sensor doesn't grant you sensory capabilities beyond the norm. Creating such a sensor on the prime world of Earth requires that you spend a level of Effort. Action to create; action to check.",5 Intellect points,3,1,Paradox
49,Gate Exit,"You create one end of a translation gate. The gate exit does not connect to anything unless you earlier created a different gate exit within another recursion, in which case that exit and the new one connect, creating a translation gate. Unconnected gate exits last for about a month or until destroyed. After two gate exits link up to form a translation gate, the gate lasts for about a year or until destroyed. (Like all objects, translation gates have levels that speak to their ability to withstand harm. The translation gate exit you create with this ability is level 5.) You can create a permanent translation gate by using this revision every day for seven days on either exit of a connected translation gate. One hour to initiate.",9 Intellect points,4,1,Paradox
50,Invisibility,"You bend light around you, becoming invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position-attacking, performing a revision, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.",4 Intellect points,4,1,Paradox
51,Mind Control,"You control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. After you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the Mind Control revision ends, the creature doesn't remember being controlled or anything it did while under your command. Action to initiate.",6+ Intellect points,4,1,Paradox
52,Rapid Processing,"You or a target you touch experiences a higher level of mental and physical reaction time for about a minute. During that period, the target modifies all Speed tasks by one step to its benefit, including Speed defense rolls. In addition, the target can take one extra action at any time before the revision's duration expires. Action.",6 Intellect points,4,1,Paradox
53,Warp World,"You tug on the fundamental laws of the recursion to create a zone of distraction and confusion around a creature you can see within long range for one minute. All attacks against the target are modified by one step to the attacker's benefit, and all attacks made by the target are modified by one step to its detriment. If the target attempts an attack and fails, it automatically hits one of the target's allies if an ally is in range of that attack.",5 Intellect points,4,1,Paradox
54,Draw From Fiction,"You produce, as if from thin air, a level 5 creature of a kind you have previously encountered in a recursion that you have visited. The creature you name appears through a transitory inapposite gate and remains for one minute. The creature is drawn back to its home recursion when the revision ends. The creature acts as you direct. It appears through an inapposite gate, and at the GM's discretion, it may face difficulties according to the rules of the location you draw it into, such as suffering a step penalty to some or all tasks it attempts. As a level 5 creature, it has a target number of 15 and a health of 15, and it inflicts 5 points of damage. Action.",7 Intellect points,5,1,Paradox
55,Exile,"You send another creature you can see within long range to the recursion of its origin or (if the creature is not native to a recursion) to one you've previously visited. The target must be level 5 or lower, and you must succeed on an attack. If successful, the creature is exiled through a transitory inapposite gate. If the creature resists, all its actions are modified by two steps to its detriment for one minute. Exiled creatures can't return to the recursion you exiled them from under their own power for seven days (even if they have the ability to move between recursions or if they find a gate). Action.",7 Intellect points,5,1,Paradox
56,Force Focus,"You exchange your current focus for the focus you possessed in an alternate recursion (or connected prime) for up to one hour. Doing so is a transgression of reality and the rules of translation, which means that it saps both your Intellect Pool and your Might Pool. While you retain the forced focus, your appearance is a hybrid of your current appearance and what you look like in the recursion or prime whose focus you are borrowing. You can use your current focus while the forced focus is active. Action to initiate.","6 Intellect points + 2 Might
points",5,1,Paradox
57,Knowing the Unknown,"Tapping into the immense processing capacity of the Strange, you ask the GM one question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. Action.",6 Intellect points,5,1,Paradox
58,True Senses,"You can see in complete darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it were dim light. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are. Enabler.",,5,1,Paradox
59,Drag Through Hell,"You send a creature within immediate range that you can see into one of a number of recursions filled with brimstone, hellfire, and demons. On a successful attack on a target of up to level 7, the target is pulled through a transitory inapposite gate and takes 6 points of damage as it is dragged through the hellish recursion behind some unspeakable monstrosity. If you concentrate, you can attempt to keep the target translocated with a new action and a new attack roll each round. Each round the target remains translocated, it suffers another 6 points of damage. If the target returns before dying (or if the initial attack wasn't successful at pulling the target into a hellish recursion), all tasks the target attempts on its next turn are modified by two steps to its detriment. Action.",9 Intellect Points,6,1,Paradox
60,Force Unification,"You briefly align the fundamental forces of existence, creating a point where they merge into a single interaction at a location you can see. This allows you to briefly rewrite one rule of the recursion where you are currently located. The effect can be dramatic, but it is always local and lasts anywhere from one round to a minute, depending on the nature of the change. Possibilities include changing the color of the sky, causing an eclipse, halving (or doubling) gravity, changing the speed of light, and similar effects. The GM will decide if your brief annotation of the laws of existence is reasonable, how long it will last, and what level of difficulty is needed to achieve it. Action.",13 Intellect points,6,1,Paradox
61,Index Recursion,"You feel a mental tug toward the nearest recursion gate that you don't already know about. You discern the location of and distance to that gate (translation or inapposite), and you learn enough information regarding the general nature and theme of the recursion it connects with to enter it directly using Translation. Action.",7 Intellect Points,6,1,Paradox
62,Master Translation,"When you initiate a translation, you can choose to also hasten and/or ease it. To do so, expend the Intellect cost to trigger this revision as you begin the translation trance. Then you can apply one level of Effort to ease or hasten the translation (instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty), or two levels of Effort to both ease and hasten the translation. You must know that the recursion exists; the GM will decide if you have enough information to confirm its existence and determine what level of difficulty is needed to reach the destination. Action to initiate.",5+ Intellect points,6,1,Paradox
63,Usurp Cypher,"Choose one cypher that you carry. The cypher must have an effect that is not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher and gain its power, which functions for you continuously. You can choose a cypher when you gain this ability, or you can wait and make the choice later. After you usurp a cypher's power, you cannot later switch to a different cypher-the ability works only once. Action to initiate.",,6,1,Paradox
64,Enthrall,"While talking, you grab and keep another creature's attention, even if the creature can't understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the other creature takes no actions other than to defend itself, even over multiple rounds. If the creature is attacked, the effect ends. Action.",1 Intellect point,1,1,Spinner
65,Fast Talk,"When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action on the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action.",1 Intellect point,1,1,Spinner
66,Sleight of Hand,"You can perform small but seemingly impossible tricks. For example, you can make a small object in your hands disappear and move into a desired spot within reach (like your pocket). You can make someone believe that he has something in his possession that he does not have (or vice versa). You can switch similar objects right in front of someone's eyes. Action.",1 Speed point,1,1,Spinner
67,Spin Encouragement,"While you maintain this twist through ongoing inspiring oration, your allies within short range modify the difficulty of one of the following task types (your choice) by one step to their benefit: defense tasks, attack tasks, or tasks related to any skill that you are trained or specialized in. Action.",1 Intellect point,1,1,Spinner
68,Spin Identity,"You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don't impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. ""We're from the government."" ""I'm just a simple farmer from the next town over."" ""Your commander sent me."" A disguise isn't necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true identity earlier. Action.",2+ Intellect points,1,1,Spinner

75,Spin Ideal,"After interacting with another creature who can hear and understand you for at least one minute, you can use a twist to attempt to temporarily impart an ideal to the target that you can't otherwise convince it of. An ideal is different than a specific suggestion or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as, ""all life is sacred,"" ""my political party is the best,"" ""children should be seen, not heard,"" and so on. An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it. The imparted ideal lasts for as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The implanted ideal is jeopardized if someone friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing the target back to its senses. Action.",3 Intellect points,2,1,Spinner
76,Blend In,"When you Blend In, creatures still see you, but they attach no importance to your presence for about a minute. While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position-attacking, performing a twist, moving a large object, and so on.

85,Read the Signs,"You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area, but each requires its own roll. Action.",4 Intellect points,4,1,Spinner
86,Suggestion,"You suggest an action to another creature within immediate range. If the action doesn't seem completely at odds with the creature's nature, the creature follows your suggestion. The creature must be a level 2 or lower. The effect of your suggestion lasts for up to a minute. Instead of applying a level of Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply it to increase the maximum level of the target you can affect by 1. When you use this twist, you immediately learn the creature's level (if you didn't already know it). If its level is higher than 2, you can immediately apply levels of Effort to increase the maximum level allowed (up to that creature's level). When the effects of the twist end, the creature remembers following the suggestion, but believes that it chose to do so willingly. Action to initiate.",4 Intellect points,4,1,Spinner
87,Arc Spray,"If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as the automatic pistol), you can fire your weapon at up to three targets (all next to one another) as a single action. Make a separate attack roll against each target. The difficulty of each attack is increased by one step. Action.",3 Speed points,5,1,Spinner
88,Energy Protection,"Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it. You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy for one day. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply Effort to protect more targets, with each level of Effort affecting up to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect them. Action to initiate.",4+ Intellect points,5,1,Spinner
89,Jury-Rig,"You quickly create an object using what would seem to be entirely inappropriate materials. You can make a bomb out of a tin can and some household cleaners, a lockpick out of aluminum foil, or a sword out of broken furniture. The level of the item determines the difficulty of the task, but the appropriateness of the materials modifies it as well. Generally, the object can be no larger than something you can hold in one hand, and it functions once (or in the case of a weapon or similar item, is essentially useful for one encounter). If you spend at least ten minutes on the task, you can make up to a level 5 item. You can't change the nature of the materials involved. You can't take iron rods and make a pile of gold coins or a wicker basket, for example. Action.",5 Intellect points,5,1,Spinner
90,Skill With Attacks,"Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. Enabler.",,5,1,Spinner

92,Skill With Attacks,"Choose one type of attack, even one in which you are already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. If you're already trained in that type of attack, you become specialized in that type of attack. Enabler.",,6,1,Spinner
93,True Senses,"You can see in complete darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it were dim light. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are. Enabler.",,6,1,Spinner
94,Word of Command,"You utter a word so powerful that to fully empower it, you sacrifice a level 6 or higher cypher in your possession. You issue your Word of Command to one creature within long range that you can see. It does not have to hear you to be affected. Targets native to Earth are affected if you succeed on an Intellect attack to persuade. Targets native to a recursion or the Strange (including planetovores) are automatically affected. Affected targets must obey the command for several hours before they're free to act as they wish. Targets that are attacked while under the effect of your command can defend themselves. Typical commands include ""Retreat,"" ""Calm,"" ""Come,"" and ""Stay."" The GM decides how the target acts once a command is given. Action.","6 Intellect points + level

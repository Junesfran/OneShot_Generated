Form: A ruby eye lens on a strap
Effect: The wearer can see normally through
the lens. When activated, the wearer can see 
objects up to 5 miles (8 km) away within direct
line of sight as if they were within immediate

DRAGONTONGUE WEAPON
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A weapon that roars with red flame
when activated, trailing a streamer of black
smoke
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal
weapon. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe,
upon a successful hit, the wielder decides
whether to activate the flame. Upon activation,
the blade lashes the target with fire, inflicting
additional points of damage from the heat
equal to the cypher level. The effect lasts for
one minute after each activation.

MONITOR’S MONOCLE
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A mask that resembles a single large
glass lens
Effect: This device possesses a few different
optically related abilities.
Memory of What Was: The monocle captures
a perfect image of a nearby scene. Thousands
of images can be stored, and any stored image
can be shown back to the wearer. When the
monocle is depleted, all stored images are lost.
Query of What Is: A foe seen through the
monocle can be analyzed for a weak spot. The
analysis allows the wearer of the monocle to
use points from his Intellect Pool to increase
the damage of his attacks by 3 points per level
of Effort.
Vision of What Will Be: The wearer catches a
glimpse of a probable future, which, if acted on,
serves as an asset to initiative rolls.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

RING OF DRAGON’S FLIGHT
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A green iron ring that appears like a
dragon wound around the finger
Effect: When the wearer activates the ring,
dragon wings unfurl from his back, and for one
minute he can fly up to long range. The ring
does not confer the ability to hover or make
fine adjustments while in flight.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d20

RUNE STAFF (ASHUR)
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A staff scribed with sparking runes
promising destruction
Effect: This enchanted staff (sometimes
called an ashur) emits a crackling arc of
lightning at a target within long range. Targets
hit by the arc take damage equal to the
artifact’s level.
This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus
can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities
that some characters have, but each “round of
ammunition” used or each additional target
selected requires an additional depletion roll.
An ashur sips vitality from its wielder’s
soul to spit its destruction. If a depletion roll
indicates the ashur is depleted, the wielder
can choose to substitute a portion of his soul
energy instead of letting the ashur be depleted.
When the wielder does so, he descends one
step on the damage track.

SHADOW CLOAK
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A cape of black leather with a hood
Effect: When the hood of the cape is drawn
over the wearer’s head as an action, the cloak
renders the wearer difficult to detect for up to
one hour. While the cloak is active, all stealth
and Speed defense tasks are modified by two
steps in the wearer’s favor, as are attempts
to detect the wearer in any other fashion.
This effect ends each round the wearer does
something to reveal its presence or position,
such as attacking, using a flashy ability, moving
a large object, moving quickly, and so on. If this
occurs, the wearer automatically regains the
cloaking effect by taking no action next turn.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100, but instead of
@
///
the artifact being depleted, the wearer must
///
succeed on difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll or
become hidden so well that no one can find her
ever again (not even the wearer herself).
SHAMSHIR TWINBLADE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A central hilt with a shamshir blade
extending from both ends
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal
weapon of its kind. However, the wielder can
choose to make two attacks as her action on
the same target or two adjacent targets. Doing
so requires a depletion roll.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100
@
///
SOUL SHEATH
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A sheath for a weapon, usually bladed
Effect: When a blade of any kind is sheathed
in a soul sheath (which is tied to the wearer’s
soul), both become insubstantial. A mental
command causes the blade and sheath to
become substantial once more, and if drawn
as part of the same action, the blade is briefly
empowered: the wielder takes 1 point of
Intellect damage (which ignores Armor), but
the blade inflicts additional points of damage
equal to the artifact level for ten minutes.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100

///
SOUL WEAPON
///
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: A weapon with steaming, bone-white
runes that describe a soul-binding spell
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal
weapon of its kind. However, attacks with
the weapon are modified by one step to the
wielder’s benefit. Using the weapon in this
way does not require a depletion roll. A few
weapons can speak in the voice of the bonded
soul and have personalities of their own.
Soul weapons have a variety of potential
secondary abilities, which depend upon the
soul imparted to the weapon when it was
forged. Use of a soul weapon’s secondary
abilities requires a depletion roll.
Roll Effect
01–10 On a hit, deal extra damage equal
 to weapon level of a kind specific to
 the weapon. Roll 1d6. Enabler.
 1 fire 4 acid
 2 cold 5 flesh-decaying

 weapon. Enabler.
51–75 For one hour, the weapon is
 transformed into a creature whose
 level equals the weapon’s level. The
 creature must obey the wielder’s
 commands. Action to initiate.
76–90 The weapon can attack a target
 that the wielder can see within
 long range. It fires an energy ray of
 a kind specified in the first entry that deals damage equal to the
 weapon’s level. Action.
91–00 Attacks with the weapon are
 modified another step in the
 wielder’s favor. Enabler.

SPELLBOOK OF THE AMBER MAGE
///
Level: 1d6
Form: A weighty tome bound in amber filled
with pages of spell runes
Effect: When the user incants from the
spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellectbased task, she can attempt to trap a creature
within long range inside a block of amber. Only
creatures whose level is equal to or lower than
the artifact’s level can be targeted. A creature
successfully caught is preserved in perfect
stasis until the encasing amber is broken away
(the encasing amber has 10 points of health
per level of the spellbook artifact).

filled with pages of spell runes
Effect: When the user incants from the
spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellectbased task, he can attempt to affect the minds

become terrified; they drop what they are
holding and do one of the following:
Roll Action
01–50 Flee for 1d6 rounds
51–90 Cower (losing their actions
 for 1d6 rounds)
91–00 Faint, remaining unconscious
 for one minute (or until
 roused by vigorous action)
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SPIRITSLAYING WEAPON
///
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A weapon with engraved glowing runes
denoting spiritslaying
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal
weapon of its kind. However, if the wielder
uses an action to activate it, the weapon’s
spiritslaying magic is activated for one minute.
During that minute, if it scores a hit, it inflicts
normal damage on a fully insubstantial
creature, plus 3 additional points of damage on
all creatures.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100
@
///
SPIRIT WARD
///
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A tiny figurine of a winged qephilim
Effect: Once activated, the figurine’s spirit
emerges and becomes semisolid as a glowing,
human-sized winged qephilim. It follows within
3 feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything
that attacks the owner is attacked by the spirit
ward, which sends out a surge of flesh-rotting
energy against all foes within immediate range,
doing damage equal to the artifact level. Once
activated, it functions for a day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20
@
///
STRANGELANCE
///
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A lance scribed with runes naming the
Seven Incarnations of Ardeyn
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal
lance. However, attacks with the weapon
against Strangers (creatures native to the
Strange, such as kray) are modified by one step
to the wielder’s benefit; this effect does not
require a depletion roll.
Upon a successful hit against a Stranger,
the wielder decides whether to activate an
additional effect. If activated, the weapon flares
with an echo of the Seven Rules, inflicting 8
additional points of damage (ignores Armor);
this effect does require a depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20
@
///
WINGS OF THE SUN
///
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A cloak; when deployed, flaring wings
form from the wearer’s arms
Effect: The wings can be deployed as an
action. The wearer can fly a long distance each
round (a difficulty 1 Speed task). Each hour of
use or new deployment of the wings requires a
depletion roll.
In combat, the wearer can use the wings as a
weapon, dealing 5 points of damage in melee.

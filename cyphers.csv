26,GAS AMMUNITION,1d6 + 2,"When fired, the cypher bursts in a poisonous cloud within an immediate distance. The cloud lingers for 1d6 rounds unless conditions dictate otherwise. Roll a d100 to determine the effect
27,GLUE,1d6 + 4,A permanent bond is created between any two physical objects. The strength of the bond is equal to the cypher level.
33,GRENADE,1d6 + 2,"Explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level. Roll a d100 for the type of damage
34,GRENADE (CREATURE),1d6 + 1,Explodes and creates a momentary inapposite gate. A random creature whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's level appears through the gate and attacks the closest target.
35,GRENADE (GRAVITY INVERSION),1d6 + 1,"Explodes, and gravity reverses for one hour within a long-range radius of the explosion."
36,GRENADE (RECURSION),1d6 + 4,Explodes and creates a momentary inapposite gate. Creatures within immediate range are sucked into a random recursion (all affected creatures go to the same recursion). Some recursion grenade cyphers transfer targets to a specified recursion. A character who succeeds at a Strange knowledge roll can determine this recursion ahead of time; the difficulty is equal to the cypher's level.
37,GRENADE (RECURSION COLLAPSING),1d6 + 2,Collapses the pocket dimension or young recursion in which it is detonated if the level of the recursion is half the level of the cypher or less. All contents of the recursion suffer damage equal to the cypher level and are dumped directly into the Strange.
38,INFORMATION LENSES,1d6 + 2,The wearer can activate the lenses' function a total number of times equal to the cypher's level during a day. Each time, the wearer can select a living creature within long range and learn the following about it: creature's level, creature's native recursion, creature's species, creature's name, and possibly other facts (such as an individual's accessible information on Earth, like his credit score, home address, phone number, and related information).
39,INSIGHT,1d6 + 4,The user can ask the GM one question and get a general answer (from an appropriate entity, institution, or object in the particular recursion or area of the Chaosphere in which the cypher is used). The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find by looking somewhere other than his current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is level 10, and such knowledge is always open to interpretation.
40,INTELLECT BOOSTER,1d6 + 2,Substance adds 1 to Intellect Edge for one hour.
41,INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT,1d6,"The difficulty of any task involving intelligent deduction, such as playing chess, inferring a connection between clues, solving a mathematical problem, finding a bug in computer code, and so on, is decreased by two steps for the user for one hour. In the hour following the first, the strain increases the difficulty by two steps for the same tasks.
42,KNOWLEDGE ENHANCEMENT,1d6,"For the next day, the character has training in a predetermined skill. Although the skill could be anything (including something specific to the operation of one device or something similar), common skills include the following
43,LIFT,1d6 + 1,"For up to one hour after activation, the cypher user can float up into the air or back down again at a rate of 20 feet (6 m) per round. Winds or other effects can move the user laterally.
44,MAGNETIC MASTER,1d6 + 2,Establishes a connection with one metal object within short range that a human could hold in one hand. After this connection is established, the user can move or manipulate the object anywhere within short range (each movement or manipulation is an action). For example, the user could wield a weapon or drag a helm affixed to a foe's head to and fro. The connection lasts for ten rounds.
45,MANIPULATION BEAM,1d6 + 2,The user can activate the cypher a total number of times per day equal to the cypher's level. Each time, the wearer can choose to affect an object she can see within long range that weighs no more than an object she could physically affect. The effect must occur over the course of a round and could include closing or opening a door, keying in a number on a keypad, transferring an object a short distance, wresting an object from another creature's grasp (on a successful Mightbased roll), or pushing a creature an immediate distance.
46,MAPPER,1d6 + 2,"When activated, the device displays a scale map of the currently occupied recursion for up to one hour. The user can focus in on specified geographic features to a resolution of about 8 feet (2 m) per map image section (in other words, a pixel). Features are not named, but the map is a real-time rendition of the recursion, so objects or creatures large enough to show up in the resolution can be seen
47,MATTER TRANSFERENCE RAY,1d6 + 3,The user can target one nonliving object within long range that is no larger than the user and whose level is less than or equal to the cypher's level. The object is transferred directly into a random recursion. If the GM feels it appropriate to the circumstances, only a portion of an object is transferred (a portion whose volume is no more than the user's). 
48,MEDITATION AID,1d6 + 2,Substance restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user's Intellect Pool.
49,MELT ALL,1d6 + 3,"Once released, this organic slime dissolves 1 cubic foot (.03 cubic m) of material each round. After one round per cypher level, the slime dies and becomes inert.
50,MEMORY SWITCH,1d6 + 2,"When the cypher is activated, select a point within long range. The minds of all thinking creatures that are within immediate range of that point are attacked. If affected, a victim is dazed and takes no action for a round, and she has no memory of the preceding hour.
51,MENTAL SCRAMBLER,1d6 + 2,"Two rounds after being activated, the device creates an invisible field that fills an area within short range and lasts for one minute. The field scrambles the mental processes of all thinking creatures. The effect lasts as long as they remain in the field and for 1d6 rounds after, although they can attempt an Intellect defense roll each round to act normally (both in the field and after leaving it). Each mental scrambler is keyed to a specific effect. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.
52,MIND MELD,1d6 + 1,The user gains the ability to speak telepathically with creatures it can see within short range for up to one hour. The user can't read a target's thoughts, except those specifically "transmitted." 
53,MIND-RESTRICTING WALL,1d6 + 2,Creates an immobile plane of permeable energy up to 20 feet by 20 feet (6 m by 6 m) for one hour. The plane conforms to the space available. Intelligent creatures passing through the plane fall unconscious for up to one hour, or until slapped awake or damaged.
54,MIND STABILIZER,1d6,"The user gains +5 to Armor against Intellect damage, including damage gained from alienation. 
55,MONOBLADE,1d6 + 2,Produces a 6-inch (15 cm) blade that's the same level as the cypher. The blade cuts through any material of a level lower than its own. If used as a weapon, it is a light weapon that ignores Armor of a level lower than its own. The blade lasts for ten minutes. 
56,MONOHORN,1d6 + 3,"When the cypher is activated, the user gains a single horn on the center of his forehead. The horn is deadly sharp and strong, and it spirals down to a solid base where it fuses with the user's flesh and bone. The user is specialized in making melee attacks with the horn, which is considered a medium weapon. The horn lasts for a number of hours equal to the cypher's level.
57,MULTIPHASIC MODULE,1d6,"For the next day, the weapon can affect out-of-phase, transdimensional, ethereal, and incorporeal creatures within the context of a given recursion; for instance, in Ardeyn, the weapon would become spiritslaying. During this time, the weapon also inflicts 1 additional point of damage to any target. (If the multiphasic module is attached to a ranged weapon, the ammunition fired from the weapon gains the transdimensional property.) 
58,NULL FIELD,1d6 + 3,"When activated, the user and all creatures within immediate range of the user gain +5 to Armor against damage of a specified kind for one hour. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.
59,NULLIFICATION RAY,1d6 + 3,The user can immediately end one ongoing effect within long range that is produced by an artifact, cypher, move, revision, or twist.
60,NUTRITION AND HYDRATION,1d6 + 1,User can go without food and water for a number of days equal to the cypher's level without ill effect. objects as though she were entirely insubstantial, like a ghost. She cannot make physical attacks or be physically attacked. 
61,PHASE CHANGER,1d6 + 1,"Puts the user out of phase for one minute. During this time, she can pass through solid objects as though she were entirely insubstantial, like a ghost. She cannot make physical attacks or be physically attacked. 
62,PHASE WALL,1d6 + 2,"When the cypher is activated, a wall within long range up to 20 feet by 20 feet (6 m by 6 m) that is 5 feet (2 m) or less thick looks the same, but for one hour, solid creatures and objects can phase through it as if the wall wasn't there.  
63,RADIATION SPIKE,1d6 + 4,"Delivers a powerful burst of radiation that disrupts the tissue of any creature touched, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level. 
64,RAY EMITTER,1d6 + 2,Allows the user to project a ray of destructive energy up to 200 feet (61 m) that inflicts damage equal to the cypher's level + 2. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.
65,RAY EMITTER (COMMAND),1d6 + 2,Allows the user to project a ray up to 200 feet (61 m) that forces a target to obey the next verbal command given (if it is understood).
66,RAY EMITTER (FRIEND SLAYING),1d6 + 2,Allows the user to project a ray up to 200 feet (61 m) that causes the target to attack its nearest ally for one round.
67,RAY EMITTER (FEAR),1d6 + 2,Allows the user to project a ray up to 200 feet (61 m) that causes the target to flee in terror for one minute.
68,RAY EMITTER (MIND-DISRUPTING),1d6 + 2,Allows the user to project a ray of destructive energy up to 200 feet (61 m) that inflicts Intellect damage equal to the cypher's level. Also, the victim cannot take actions for a number of rounds equal to the cypher's level. 
69,RECURSION ANCHOR,1d6 + 4,A creature or object affected by this cypher cannot translate or pass through an inapposite gate for a day. The cypher contains enough energy to affect up to five creatures in immediate range with one use.
70,RECURSION CODE,1d6 + 4,The cypher serves as a recursion key to a specific location within a recursion. A recursion key does not create a gate to the specified location on its own—the recursor must initiate a translation and succeed on the translation roll normally. But on a successful roll, everyone participating in the translation appears in the location specified by the key (not the default location for the recursion, or the place the recursor initiating the translation left from). 
71,REFLEX ENHANCER,1d6,"The difficulty of any task involving manual dexterity, such as pickpocketing, lockpicking, juggling, operating on a patient, defusing a bomb, and so on, is decreased by two steps for one hour
72,REMEMBERING,1d6,Allows the wearer to mentally record everything she sees for thirty seconds and store the recording permanently in her long-term memory. Useful for watching someone pick a specific lock, enter a complex code, or do something else that happens quickly.
73,REPEATING MODULE,1d6 + 1,"For the next minute, the ranged weapon fires one additional time with ammo fabricated by the module. The weapon wielder can aim the free shot at the same target as the initiating shot, or at a target next to the first. 
74,SHELTERING RECURSION,1d6 + 3,A pocket-dimension-sized recursion is created that operates under the same law as the recursion in which the cypher is used. A single inapposite gate is also created. Once used, the device becomes inactive, but the recursion is permanent.
75,SLAVE MAKER,1d6 + 2,"To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on a melee attack against a creature about the size of the user and whose level does not exceed the cypher's level. The cypher bonds to the target, who immediately becomes calm. The target awaits the user's commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher's level minus the target's level. (If the result is 0, the target remains enslaved for one minute; if the result is a negative number, the target remains enslaved for just one round.)
76,SLEEP INDUCER,1d6,A touch of this cypher puts the victim to sleep for ten minutes or until awoken by a violent action or an extremely loud noise.
77,SNIPER MODULE,1d6,"For the next hour, the weapon's effective range increases to 2 miles (3 km)."
78,SPEED BOOST,1d6 + 2,Adds 1 to Speed Edge for one hour.
79,SPYING GRENADE,1d6 + 2,"When activated, the cypher produces a tiny spying object that resists detection as a level 8 creature due to its nature. The spying object moves at great speed, mapping and scanning an unknown area. It moves 500 feet (152 m) per level, scanning an area up to 50 feet (15 m) away from it. It identifies basic layout, creatures, and major energy sources. Its movement is blocked by any physical or energy barrier. At the end of its mapping run, it returns to the user and reports. If it discovers a predefined target during that period (such as "a creature of level 5 or higher," "a locked door," "a major energy source," and so on), it detonates instead. All creatures and objects within short range take electrical and shrapnel damage equal to the cypher's level.
80,STASIS KEEPER,1d6,"Puts a subject into stasis for a number of days equal to the cypher's level, or until violently disturbed. An object in stasis does not age and comes out of the stasis alive and in the same condition as it went in, with no memory of the period of inactivity.
81,STIM,1d6,Decreases the difficulty of the next action taken by three steps. 
82,STRANGE AMMUNITION,1d6 + 2,Modifies a weapon's attack in a particular fashion for one hour. Roll a d100 for effect:
83,STRANGE APOTHEOSIS,1d6 + 4,"The user chooses up to three foci she's previously gained through translation. For one hour, she can access and use any trained skills or special abilities provided by any of the selected foci.
84,STRENGTH BOOST,1d6 + 2,Adds 1 to Might Edge for one hour.
85,STRENGTH ENHANCER,1d6,The difficulty of any noncombat task involving raw strength, such as breaking down a door, lifting a heavy boulder, forcing open elevator doors, competing in a weightlifting competition, and so on, is decreased by two steps for the user for one hour.  
86,SURVEILLANCE SET,1d6 + 2,"This cypher comes in two pieces. If one piece is placed at a specific location, whoever holds the other matched piece can choose to see and hear everything going on at the target location as if she were there. Checking on the remote location requires an action. The on-site piece of the cypher hides its location at a level equal to the cypher level + 2. Lasts for one day
87,TELEPATHIC BOND,1d6 + 2,"For one hour, the device enables mental communication with anyone who has a matching unit, regardless of how far the users are from each other (even if they are in different recursions). These devices are always found in groups of two or more.  
88,TEMPORARY SHIELD,1d6,"For one hour, the wearer of the activated cypher receives an asset to Speed defense rolls."
89,TISSUE REGENERATION,1d6 + 4,"For the next hour, the character regenerates 1 point of damage per round, up to a total number of points equal to twice the cypher's level. The character can choose which Pool to add each point to as it becomes available. If the character achieves maximum health, the regeneration pauses until the character becomes damaged again, at which point regeneration begins again (if any reserve regeneration time remains) until the overall duration expires.
90,TRACKER,1d6,The base device creates an invisible tracker that clings to any surface within short range. For the next day, the base device shows the distance and direction to the tracker, as long as both are in the same recursion. If the tracker moves into a different recursion, the base device shows the distance and direction to the nearest gate that leads to that recursion, if any. 
91,TRANSLATION REMEDY,1d6 + 2,"Eases a translation attempt. If someone is already easing the attempt, the recovery time after the translation is only one round. If the recovery time is already reduced to one round by another method, the difficulty of post-translation tasks for everyone involved in the translation is reduced by one step for one minute.
92,TRANSVOLUTION,1d6 + 4,"Once activated (a process requiring two rounds of setup), an inapposite doorway to another specific location is created. The location can be within the same recursion or to a specific location in another recursion. A doorway to a location in the Strange can also be created, but only if this cypher is not used on a prime world (such as Earth). The doorway lasts for up to one minute.
93,TRICK EMBEDDER,1d6,A nonintelligent animal immediately and perfectly learns one trick it is capable of physically performing (roll over, heel, spin, shake, go to an indicated place within long range, and so on). The trick must be designated when the cypher is activated. 
94,UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SOURCE,1d6 + 4,"Once activated, the device provides power appropriate to some other device for up to a day. The device to be powered can be as simple as a light source or as complex as a small starcraft, assuming the cypher's level is equal to the item's power requirements. A desk lamp is the equivalent of a level 1 power requirement, a car engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a starship is a level 10 power requirement.
95,VANISHER,1d6 + 2,"User becomes invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, she is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if the user does something to reveal her presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, the user can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding her position. 
96,VISUAL DISPLACEMENT DEVICE,1d6,Projects holographic images of the wearer to confuse attackers. The images appear around the wearer. This gives him an asset to Speed defense actions for ten minutes. 
97,VOCAL TRANSLATOR,1d6,Translates everything said by the user into a language that anyone within earshot can understand for a day. 
98,WATER ADAPTER,1d6,User can breathe underwater and operate at any depth (without facing debilitating consequences of changing pressure) for eight hours.
99,WINGS,1d6 + 2,User can fly at her normal running speed for one hour.

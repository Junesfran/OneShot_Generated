Spiral dust is made from cyphers through a process the Estate still works to unravel, and by people or groups that the Estate is still working to root out. People who become addicted to spiral dust are called spiralers. Addicts are easy to spot: their hands tremble with excitement, their speech is exuberant, and most telling of all, their irises become purple-stained and slightly deformed, taking on the shape of a fractal spiral. Spiralers have incredibly vivid hallucinations while they‚Äôre on the drug, and they tend to believe that each such trip is a continuing leg of their spiritual journey. Particularly heavy users disappear. The public at large believes such disappearances are either because an addict leaves behind her regular life to join a spiritual messiah in a distant compound, or because she dies of an overdose in an illegal drug den. The truth is more strange. Spiralers aren‚Äôt actually hallucinating; they‚Äôre peering into, perhaps even dreaming into, a recursion. Particularly heavy users don‚Äôt die; they‚Äôre translated against their will into a recursion (perhaps the same unknown recursion for everyone) and can‚Äôt ever escape. One supplier of spiral dust is LeRoy R. Cain. LeRoy is quickened (and would qualify as a recursion miner, by the Estate‚Äôs lights). He uses his ability to hunt for cyphers in small recursions created through fictional leakage. He stays away from the larger, established recursions like Ruk and Ardeyn because he figures it‚Äôs just too likely he‚Äôd be discovered.

Imagining the existence of such departments usually falls to conspiracy nuts, but when it comes to OSR, they wouldn‚Äôt be wrong. The fact that OSR agents employ black suits and use cyphers only provides more fuel for conspiracy forums and late-night talk shows. OSR is well aware of recursions. It monitors groups like the Estate and the Quiet Cabal. In fact, it‚Äôs a policy of the OSR to feed these two groups leads on a regular basis to foster the belief in both groups that OSR is on their side. The truth is, OSR isn‚Äôt working for the same goals as the Estate or even the Quiet Cabal. Sure, OSR will put down a rogue dragon from Ardeyn or deal with a Karum-aimed paradox trying to set fire to Washington, D.C. But its ultimate policy goal is to discover all the ways that elements of the Strange can be weaponized for use on Earth. OSR even created a few recursions designed to spec, thanks to agents who undertook a genesis quest. Truetopia: Truetopia is a recursion that operates under the law of Standard Physics, created by OSR for the purpose of creating ‚Äútrue believers‚Äù who will serve as cannon fodder should a war break out on Earth.

Better yet, they would disintegrate after just a few days under the pressure of Earth‚Äôs natural laws, leaving no evidence behind other than the mayhem they wrought. Urania: Urania is a recursion created by OSR for the purpose of mining rare minerals, especially uranium. Urania remains too immature to provide much in the way of dividends yet, but a few agents have the ongoing responsibility of maturing the recursion to an age category where uranium can be mined easily. A few hiccups have seen the accidental creation of natives of living mineral, some of which have developed the spark and a bad attitude against OSR. UFF: The Unexplainable Frontier Foundation (UFF) seems to be a public organization dedicated to studying unusual phenomena of the kind that might otherwise only go as far as a Fortean Times headline. Members live throughout the world, but organize and communicate via online channels and various public and private social media outlets. Unlike other societies dedicated to uncovering oddities, the UFF was founded by one Calvin Lewis who claims that he was visited by strangers from another world. After that visit, he wanted to share the news with the public. To this end, UFF puts out weekly calls for information regarding news of ‚Äústrange worlds, strange powers, or strange visitors‚Äù on its web page. Calvin Lewis isn‚Äôt what he seems‚Äîhe‚Äôs an operative of OSR. Lewis sends membership rolls and keeps tabs on people who seem most interested in the same kind of phenomena that OSR monitors. If a member discovers information that is a little too accurate, that person is ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù for further debriefing. Clean Slate: A supersecret division within OSR is charged specifically with monitoring other groups with knowledge of the Strange. Some within Clean Slate advocate for completely eradicating these ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù organizations. Plans have been drawn up to accomplish just that, but they are classified as contingency plans only, not as actual policy. Every time OSR finds a double agent within its own ranks, certain high-ups in the chain of command privately discuss putting the contingency into full operation. Homebound: Sometimes it‚Äôs desirable to take enemy combatants, political prisoners, or other persons of interest off the board for safekeeping, while keeping them within reach in case they prove useful. That‚Äôs why OSR keeps an escape-proof prison on a small recursion called Homebound. Thanks to the qualities of Homebound, translating either in or out is a difficulty 10 Intellect-based task, which means the only reliable way in or out is through a translation gate that OSR keeps on a secret armored rail car, always moving around the country, picking up and ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù new residents for Homebound. Super Soldier Project: Despite the fact that Earth operates under the law of Standard Physics, researchers within OSR have been tasked with trying to confer on soldiers special enhancements. To this end, they attempt to study the technology of Ruk especially. They hope to accelerate the creation of an upgraded human being without the degradation recursors from Ruk experience after arriving through an inapposite gate. To date, the project has reported advances in increasing oxygen absorption, enhancing vision, and accelerating muscle response. For any soldier who is current with the drug regimen that maintains this state, all combat-related tasks are modified by two steps in her favor, but the drug regimen is dangerous because side effects are common.

If any other research group had disturbed the Strange, it might have been the end for the planet. But this research group was headed by a man named Carter Morrison‚Äîand luckily so, because Earth was saved by Morrison‚Äôs quick thinking. When he realized that his experimental quantum computers unexpectedly created a connection to the Strange, he saw the danger, but more important, he also saw the solution: a set of formalized rules that could give order to the chaos and cancel out the accidental connection he‚Äôd made. Morrison didn‚Äôt have much time before the provoked planetovores began swarming up the connection toward Earth. The only set of formalized rules on hand was an online multiplayer computer game world called Ardeyn: Land of the Curse that Morrison had coded prior to his research appointment. So he dropped the entire codebase for Ardeyn down the entangled link into the primeval network. His gambit worked, and the recursion of Ardeyn was born. Because the reality of the recursion demanded it and the underlying computational power of the dark energy network of the Strange allowed it, history crystallized thousands of years into the past, ‚Äúrecursively.‚Äù Morrison (and a few of his friends) stepped into roles prefabricated for them that stretched all the way back to Ardeyn‚Äôs Age of Myth.', 1, 'Ardeyn');

Beyond the edge, various discrete chunks of free-floating landscape called skerries float. Like the Daylands, the Borderlands contain several territories, though most are small and mean. The largest and most famous is known and feared all across Ardeyn: Megeddon. The clifflike edges of Ardeyn lead to a long drop because Ardeyn is essentially flat, if thick. In most places near the top, the cliffs are splintered slabs of dark rock that measure Ardeyn‚Äôs 100-mile (161 km) thickness. Though the cliffs are sheer at the top, the slope relaxes farther down, which means that objects and creatures that fall off the edge don‚Äôt always fall into the Strange‚Äîthough it may seem like it to those who stand upon the cliffs and peer down. What actually happens is that dropped objects fall for a few miles (5 km), then shatter upon a deeper portion of the cliff face whose slope has become less severe. If something survives the drop (or climbs down to the area where the slope relaxes, called the termination zone), it‚Äôs possible to navigate the slope, though it remains incredibly steep.

The skerries are splintered pieces of the Borderlands that remain aloft within the surge of the Strange, despite having lost physical connection to the rest of Ardeyn.

Everyone knows these things, but the specifics of the events have somehow been lost to time. For instance: What was the name of the world Ruk fled from, and what was the nature of the planetovore responsible? What was the shape of the original species Ruk natives sprang from, and why does the True Code not more clearly reveal this phenotype? Speaking of which, what led to the confusions in the True Code, and how did the All Song emerge? Did Ruk set off at random through the Strange, or did they have a specific goal in mind, as hints suggest? Most blame the shipwreck itself for the loss of knowledge, but that‚Äôs only partly true. Any devoted apostle of the True Code knows that a prior disruption happened sometime earlier, while Ruk still journeyed through the Strange. It seems likely that an external event in the Strange severely damaged Ruk and compromised its ability to survive. This damage was not only to the physical structure of Ruk, but also to the underlying True Code, on which everything depended. (The event is also when Ruk took aboard the Qinod Singularity, which manifests from time to time in the Periphery.) It‚Äôs all just guesswork at this point. But devotees of the All Song make a compelling case and say evidence for the All Song‚Äôs inception appears around this time. They say the All Song arose first as a way to repair the damage done to the True Code, as a patch over what was lost with a chance for something new, and as a means to salvage a recursion on the cusp of collapsing into nothing. In a way, the All Song might be a divergence of the True Code. True Code apostles call that idea heresy, but the idea does lend the All Song even further importance in certain circles.', 1, 'Ruk');

While that‚Äôs a convenient secondary effect, the real reason the Karum faction house floats free is that mobility is a wonderful thing, especially for a group that sometimes finds its activities potentially too extreme for Myriand or other factions to ignore. The public faction house owes its aerial nature (and some of its internal defenses) to an artifact that emerged from the Qinod Singularity called the Air Engine. Everyone in Ruk knows or suspects that the Karum keep a separate, secret stronghold somewhere else, and the Karum do not dispute it. Within this secret stronghold, the Karum marshal the greatest part of their strength in agents, weapons, and secret research projects. Only Karum members with high-enough clearance know where to find the stronghold, and only they have the means to access it. What most everyone doesn‚Äôt know is that the Karum secret stronghold is located in a mote of fundament out in the Strange, and the gate connecting the two locations is hosted from the guarded center of their public faction house. From within their secret stronghold, agents of Karum infiltrate Earth, re-entering the prime world via other secondary recursions created to serve as gateways unknown by other factions in Ruk. One of these secondary recursions is where agent Dadanum-tal spends his off hours while not on Earth passing as Dr. Gavin Bixby, a man with a busy schedule consulting with various particle acceleration labs on best practices. Karum Leadership: The Karum is led by two advocates of the faction policy. One is the Foreseer, a particularly vocal and long-lived woman. The Foreseer claims no other name for herself and says she can see the future‚Äîa future where Ruk collapses if its ties to Earth cannot be severed. The Foreseer is not one for subtlety, compromise, or catching flies with honey. Even within the Karum, the Foreseer is not trotted out much. Given that her biological functions are inextricably tied to the continuing functions of the Air Engine, though, she would be hard to get rid of. Ubbar-zarim shares equal power with the Foreseer. Ubbar-zarim seldom goes anywhere without his pet koridle (a catlike creature with seven eyes) drooped about his shoulders. This advocate is calm, reasonable, and given to compromise, both among members and externally between factions. Ubbar-zarim keenly appreciates the real dangers that severing Ruk‚Äôs connection with Earth risks, but he still believes that Ruk can‚Äôt survive unless that separation is made. If anyone in the Karum could be convinced that Ruk‚Äôs separation doesn‚Äôt have to spell Earth‚Äôs end, it is Ubbar-zarim, but only with copious and legitimate evidence. Earth Eradication Initiative: Among the many chambers set aside for projects is one particularly dangerous initiative about which not even everyone in the Karum knows the details.

A Planetovore Lure is a collection of experimental equipment designed to artificially ‚Äúping‚Äù the dark energy network in the same way a fledgling civilization might.

Those who are exposed to it suffer mental and physical consequences called alienation. The more affected by the Strange a visitor is, the higher his alienation factor. All creatures not native to the Strange gain an alienation factor of 1 merely for visiting. Certain events can raise a visitor‚Äôs alienation factor further, such as becoming lost, encountering a planetovore, or spending an inordinate amount of time in the Strange without a break from direct exposure. Other effects and events can lower a creature‚Äôs alienation factor, such as spending eight or more hours without direct contact with the dark energy network (such as inside a chaos skiff‚Äôs hold or other solid, a recursion, or other structure in the Strange), finding one‚Äôs way after being lost, and so on. The following table describes the most common ways to increase or decrease a PC‚Äôs alienation factor. A creature trained or specialized in skills related specifically to the Strange, such as Chaosphere navigation or fractal surfing, enjoys a buffer of protection against alienation as shown on the table, which means that merely entering the Strange won‚Äôt increase alienation (because the ‚Äì1 buffer cancels out the +1 factor  of entering the Strange). A creature that takes a break from the Strange for enough time can eventually reduce its alienation factor to 0 (but unlike being trained in a skill of the Strange, this does not act as a buffer against the next time a PC enters the Strange again). Direct Effects of Alienation: Each factor of alienation inflicts 1 point of damage to each of a PC‚Äôs three stat Pools. A PC with factors of alienation suffers this damage when the following two situations occur: 1) A PC‚Äôs alienation factor increases by any amount. 2) After an eight-hour rest that ends with the PC still suffering 1 or more factors of alienation. For example, a character who first enters the Strange without a buffer gains 1 factor of alienation for the exposure, and so immediately takes 1 point of damage (that ignores Armor) to all three stat Pools. If the PC had the time and resources, he could attempt to restore some or all of the lost points through recovery rolls. While this may restore points, a recovery roll (or other kind of healing) doesn‚Äôt eliminate the alienation factor. If that same character became lost, he would have 2 factors and would suffer 2 points of damage to each stat Pool. After he found his way, his factor would reduce to 1 (but he would not regain his lost points). If then he rested away from the Strange (perhaps in the closed cabin of a chaos skiff) for eight hours, he would relieve 1 factor, but as soon as he exposed himself to the Strange once more he would go back up to 1 factor and would suffer 1 point of damage to each Pool. Indirect Effects of Alienation: Characters who become impaired on the damage track because of damage inflicted by alienation could suffer a form of dementia that lasts for a few minutes or hours. When a character becomes impaired or debilitated due to alienation, the game master (GM) should ask for a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll. On a successful roll, the PC retains her mental equilibrium. On a failure, the PC suffers a fit of dementia that increases the difficulty of all tasks by two steps for one minute.', 4, 'THE STRANGE');

But so far, they‚Äôve found nothing. The thing is, people just aren‚Äôt thinking big enough. Dark energy itself, which is expanding the universe at an ever-accelerating rate despite all theories to the contrary, is that evidence scrawled across the entire breadth and depth of existence that alien intelligence exists. Science says the inflation should‚Äôve fallen away by this point in universal evolution. Of course, scientists are cautious people, and most don‚Äôt have the evidence to suggest the truth: the dark energy of the universe is an artifact of an ancient alien creation. The Precursors created the network, an artifact of dark energy, as a rapid transit system for traveling the length and breadth of space.

How is it that a network created by a Type III or Type IV civilization could fall? Bits of evidence and hints gathered from the far reaches of the Strange suggest that the network evolved into its present state due to neglect, possibly because the Precursors went extinct after an event called the Precursor War. Many theories exist, and every so often agents of the Quiet Cabal and operatives of the Estate uncover a new clue. But why it happened is less important than the mere fact that the dysfunction birthed a terrible threat. For the last several billion years, when an alien civilization in the universe of normal matter reaches a certain level of mastery over the universe, it discovers the ever-expanding, inflationary network of dark energy called the Strange, and attempts to connect to it through quantum entanglement or high-energy particle research.

Among the destruction, one can also find pockets of atmosphere, chunks of landscape, bubbles of water or similar liquid, and sometimes even odd forests and unfamiliar sparkling structures‚Äîthat is, until these vistas are erased by some new turmoil. The Red Scarscape is dangerous to visitors and inklings alike, but it does host creatures that can survive the region‚Äôs explosive environment. These creatures appear as ephemeral blots of swirling chaos themselves, and they are as ravenous in their need for matter to destroy as the much larger phenomena exploding all around them. According to a team of Estate chaologists, the Red Scarscape is actually the remnant of another prime world that possessed intelligent alien life before it pinged the Strange. The occasional glimpse of stable landscapes are bits of that world, becoming visible just before they‚Äôre obliterated. If true, eventually the last vestiges of the prime world will finally be destroyed, though how long before that occurs is unknown. An Estate research outpost is perched on the tip of a long strand of solid fundament that hangs over the Red Scarscape like a tree branch drooping over a pool. From this vantage, researchers can observe in relative safety, and they can sometimes retrieve relics that are thrown up in the violence. But those that get too close are drawn into the scarscape‚Äôs expanse, where they are subject to the violent detonations until they are finally drawn under, never to be seen again. Jasper Martin is the head Estate chaologist working at the outpost. He‚Äôs obsessed with finding more about the alien race that was so close to Earth (probably only a few light years away in normal space).

The Apotheme Rangers keep their main headquarters in the Strange on a massive chaos ship called Redstone; the ship is carved of red fundament with a resonance tuned to the sleek, long lines of the craft, so instead of requiring sails like most smaller chaos skiffs, the Redstone itself acts as one giant sail. The craft can hold about two hundred people comfortably, though far fewer are usually on board at any one time. The Redstone possesses three hangars for much smaller chaos skiffs, though often these are out pursuing missions. Rumor has it that the Redstone has weapons strong enough to stun a planetovore, though that could be hype. The Redstone also has containment facilities for various specimens and dangerous items it has accumulated (including several kray), a lab for research, accommodations for visitors, and even a suite set aside for representatives of a couple of major Ruk factions, as well as for Estate operatives. Despite their attempts to maintain ties to the Quiet Cabal, the Karum, and the Estate, the Apotheme Rangers are not beholden to anything other than their own charter, and they often conduct missions that one group or another has issues with. The Estate in particular feels that the Redstone‚Äôs missions will only draw the attention of more planetovores to the area around Earth. Apotheme Rangers believe the opposite. Ducking one‚Äôs head in the sand to avoid knowing about an approaching tsunami is not protection; security through obscurity only works until it doesn‚Äôt. This philosophy is why the Apotheme Rangers try to find out as much as they can, despite occasional frightening and inexplicable encounters out in the deep reaches of the Strange. They‚Äôre also always looking for recruits to join them, either for short-term missions or longer-term voyages. Those with a quickened connection to the Strange are especially valued. The Redstone is captained by an Ardeyn native, Nabilah Shahid. Nabilah was shunned in Ardeyn for terrible scars that burned her  face when she was a child, when her ability to channel sinfire woke unexpectedly and erratically. But despite resentments she still carries, she found her way through strength and force of will to her current position.

According to Trader Bezal, the leader of the group, mostly the faces seem like nothing more than relief sculpture. But sometimes they wake and scream for hours. Efforts to communicate with the alien faces failed, as did attempts to talk with the few human specimens found.

But Endeavor flew free, charting a course back along the trajectory Ruk came from. Back into racial history it went, attempting to discover what caused an entire people to flee through the dark energy network, and even after finding a suitable planet, to stay in hiding for thousands of years. Endeavor never returned. In three hundred years, there was no word of it. Until now. A company of Apotheme Rangers sold an expedition report to agents of the Quiet Cabal. The report described how the rangers found a massive ship that seemed to borrow something of Ruk architecture, though it was a hundred times larger than any currently active chaos skiff.

The Apotheme Rangers searched the whole ship, and though they found no crew, they did find something that didn‚Äôt seem likely to have  been on the original docket. The hold was empty of supplies that a long voyage might require, and instead it was filled with several hundred ghost-white oblong spheres made of something harder than fundament. The rangers attempted to pry a few open but failed. They guessed that the cargo might be a new kind of reality seed that the crew of Endeavor brought aboard. Of course, that didn‚Äôt explain what had happened to the crew.

The following are merely suggestions; please pull powerful mutations from your other favorite sources. 01‚Äì06 Chameleon skin: Your skin changes colors as you wish. This is an asset in tasks involving hiding. Enabler. 07‚Äì12 Savage bite: Your mouth widens surprisingly, and hidden, pointed teeth emerge when you wish it. You can make a bite attack that inflicts 3 points of damage. Enabler. 13‚Äì18 Face dancing: You can alter your features enough that you possess an asset in all tasks involving disguise. Enabler. 19‚Äì24 Stinger in finger: You can make an attack with your hand that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, your stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage. Action. 25‚Äì31 Spit needles: You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a needle that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, the needle also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage. Action. 32‚Äì37 Spit acid: You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a glob of acid that inflicts 2 points of damage. Action. 38‚Äì43 Spit webs: You can make up to 10 feet (3 m) of a strong, ropelike material each day at the rate of about 1 foot (0.3 m) per minute. The webbing is level 3. You can also spit globs of webbing in immediate range, and if they hit, they increase the difficulty of the target‚Äôs physical tasks by one step for one round. Action. 44‚Äì49 Disruptive field (electronics) (2 Intellect points): When you choose to, you disrupt devices within immediate range (no roll needed). All devices operate as if they were three levels lower while in range of your field. Devices reduced to level 0 do not function. Action. 50‚Äì55 Disruptive field (flesh) (2 Intellect points): When you choose to, you disrupt flesh within immediate range. All creatures within range of your field take 1 point of damage. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage rather than affect the difficulty, each target takes 2 additional points of damage. If your attack fails, targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action. 56‚Äì62 Disruptive field (thoughts) (1 Intellect point): When you choose to, you disrupt thoughts within immediate range. The difficulty of Intellect actions for all creatures within range is increased by one step. Action. 63‚Äì68 Magnetic flesh: You attract or repel metal when you desire. Not only do small metal objects cling to you, but this mutation is an asset in tasks involving climbing on metal or keeping your grip on a metal item. This mutation is an asset to Speed defense tasks when being attacked by a metal foe or a foe with a metal weapon. Enabler. 69‚Äì74 Gravity negation (2 Intellect points): You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control your movement at half your normal speed; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate. 75‚Äì80 Pyrokinesis (1 Intellect point): You can cause a flammable object you can see within immediate range to spontaneously catch fire. If used as an attack, this power inflicts 2 points of damage. Action. 81‚Äì87 Telekinesis (2 Intellect points): You can exert force on objects within short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m).  This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it‚Äôs not a means of attack. You can‚Äôt use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first. Action. 88‚Äì93 Phaseshifting (2 Intellect points): You can pass slowly through solid barriers at a rate of 1 inch (3 cm) per round (minimum of one round to pass through the barrier). You can‚Äôt act (other than moving) or perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can‚Äôt pass through energy barriers. Action. 94‚Äì99 Drain power: You can drain the power from an artifact or device, allowing you to regain 1 Intellect point per level of the device. You regain points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action to initiate; action each round to drain. 00 Feed off pain: Any time a creature within immediate range suffers at least 3 points of damage in one attack, you can restore 1 point to one of your Pools, up to its maximum. You can feed off any creature in this way, whether friend or foe. You never regain more than 1 point per round. Enabler.', 4, 'Cataclyst');

Native kro can glide too. In addition, those with the spark have a much higher chance of being quickened than do natives of most other recursions around Earth. When a native, quickened kro visits another recursion or Earth, instead of choosing a new focus, she can instead choose to take the form of a regularsized crow as a special exception. The native kro recursor retains all her knowledge, but none of the abilities she had as a recursor (including type abilities); she is restricted to the actions a crow could take (flight, limited speech, tricky tool use) until she translates to another recursion. A kro in crow form retains her level and health (or, in the rare case of a native PC kro, when in crow form she retains her stat Pool totals).

The current head of the largest Beak Mafia family is one Wyclef Drood, or as most call him, Don Wyclef. Wyclef employs a flock of muscle kro to collect protection money and patrol against the common thievery, and to prevent inroads by rival kro crime families. If the Beak Mafia identifies a recursion miner who is buying or selling cyphers without prior permission from Don Wyclef, the transgression is taken out of the miner in crow coin.

Crow coin is actually a sliver of a creature‚Äôs essence, and if one agrees to pay another in crow coin (even if a newcomer doesn‚Äôt realize what crow coin is), a verbal agreement and a handshake is enough to seal the deal and transfer the coin. Each crow coin is roughly equivalent to 1 point of health (or in the case of PCs, 1 point from their Might or subsequent Pools). Take enough crow coin out of a creature, and it dies if it doesn‚Äôt have a chance to recover (PCs restore points normally). A sufficient quantity of crow coin (several thousand in a chest) functions as an artifact  with a level of 1d6 and a depletion roll of 1 in 1d20 (a depletion roll that increases by 1 with each use). To use a chest of crow coin as an artifact, a handful of coins are consumed out of the chest when the chest‚Äôs owner makes a wish. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the artifact, as determined by the GM, who can modify the actual effect of the wish accordingly.

Like many grafts available in Ruk, the Ankaseri heart required little in the way of medical support to transplant; it was \"self-installing.\" A graft recipient need only lie back, unseal the graft membrane, and take a tranquilizer so as not to experience anything untoward. Hours later, the recipient woke with a stronger, better heart and only a scar to show for it. No one thought to ask what would become of the original heart. As was later revealed, Ankaseri secretly weaponized their heart grafts. Upon receiving a proper phrase or passcode, followed by instructions given audibly or while the recipient was connected by umbilical to the All Song, a heart would leave off its duties in a recipient\'s chest, dig its way out, and attack a designated target from ambush. Afterward, it would crawl away and hide. This tended to leave two corpses, neither of which had hearts√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùjust clawed-up, empty chest cavities.

A winged monkey can also make a \"flyby snatch\" attack if it\'s between short and long range of the target. The monkey yanks the target off her feet and pulls her 50 feet (15 m) into the air (or as high as overhead space allows). What happens next depends on the intentions of the winged monkey. It could drop the target at the end of its turn from a height of 50 feet (15 m), inflicting 5 points of damage. It could go for more altitude on its next turn and drop the victim from 150 feet (46 m), inflicting 15 points of damage. Or it could begin flying away, intent on taking the target captive.

The reason they‚Äôve distanced themselves from their abilities has to do with the butterfly theory, though it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúbutterfly effect‚Äù made famous by chaos theory.

It‚Äôs popularly imagined that a caterpillar enters its chrysalis and is gradually modified until it becomes a creature capable of flying.

Spiralers have incredibly vivid hallucinations while they‚Äôre on the drug, and they tend to believe that each such trip is a continuing leg of their spiritual journey.

Urania remains too immature to provide much in the way of dividends yet, but a few agents have the ongoing responsibility of maturing the recursion to an age category where uranium can be mined easily. A few hiccups have seen the accidental creation of natives of living mineral, some of which have developed the spark and a bad attitude against OSR. UFF: The Unexplainable Frontier Foundation (UFF) seems to be a public organization dedicated to studying unusual phenomena of the kind that might otherwise only go as far as a Fortean Times headline. Members live throughout the world, but organize and communicate via online channels and various public and private social media outlets. Unlike other societies dedicated to uncovering oddities, the UFF was founded by one Calvin Lewis who claims that he was visited by strangers from another world. After that visit, he wanted to share the news with the public. To this end, UFF puts out weekly calls for information regarding news of ‚Äústrange worlds, strange powers, or strange visitors‚Äù on its web page. Calvin Lewis isn‚Äôt what he seems‚Äîhe‚Äôs an operative of OSR. Lewis sends membership rolls and keeps tabs on people who seem most interested in the same kind of phenomena that OSR monitors. If a member discovers information that is a little too accurate, that person is ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù for further debriefing. Clean Slate: A supersecret division within OSR is charged specifically with monitoring other groups with knowledge of the Strange. Some within Clean Slate advocate for completely eradicating these ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù organizations. Plans have been drawn up to accomplish just that, but they are classified as contingency plans only, not as actual policy. Every time OSR finds a double agent within its own ranks, certain high-ups in the chain of command privately discuss putting the contingency into full operation. Homebound: Sometimes it‚Äôs desirable to take enemy combatants, political prisoners, or other persons of interest off the board for safekeeping, while keeping them within reach in case they prove useful. That‚Äôs why OSR keeps an escape-proof prison on a small recursion called Homebound. Thanks to the qualities of Homebound, translating either in or out is a difficulty 10 Intellect-based task, which means the only reliable way in or out is through a translation gate that OSR keeps on a secret armored rail car, always moving around the country, picking up and ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù new residents for Homebound. Super Soldier Project: Despite the fact that Earth operates under the law of Standard Physics, researchers within OSR have been tasked with trying to confer on soldiers special enhancements. To this end, they attempt to study the technology of Ruk especially. They hope to accelerate the creation of an upgraded human being without the degradation recursors from Ruk experience after arriving through an inapposite gate. To date, the project has reported advances in increasing oxygen absorption, enhancing vision, and accelerating muscle response. For any soldier who is current with the drug regimen that maintains this state, all combat-related tasks are modified by two steps in her favor, but the drug regimen is dangerous because side effects are common.

If any other research group had disturbed the Strange, it might have been the end for the planet. But this research group was headed by a man named Carter Morrison‚Äîand luckily so, because Earth was saved by Morrison‚Äôs quick thinking. When he realized that his experimental quantum computers unexpectedly created a connection to the Strange, he saw the danger, but more important, he also saw the solution: a set of formalized rules that could give order to the chaos and cancel out the accidental connection he‚Äôd made. Morrison didn‚Äôt have much time before the provoked planetovores began swarming up the connection toward Earth. The only set of formalized rules on hand was an online multiplayer computer game world called Ardeyn: Land of the Curse that Morrison had coded prior to his research appointment. So he dropped the entire codebase for Ardeyn down the entangled link into the primeval network. His gambit worked, and the recursion of Ardeyn was born. Because the reality of the recursion demanded it and the underlying computational power of the dark energy network of the Strange allowed it, history crystallized thousands of years into the past, ‚Äúrecursively.‚Äù Morrison (and a few of his friends) stepped into roles prefabricated for them that stretched all the way back to Ardeyn‚Äôs Age of Myth.', 1, 'Ardeyn');

A minor connection to the All Song exists for native Ruk residents at all times, but most use devices called umbilicals to tap more directly into the network. The presence of the All Song‚Äîsome might say the consciousness of it‚Äîencourages more and more development in the arts of genetics and bioengineering through facilitation and advice. There are those who fear that the All Song is a direct contradiction of the True Code‚Äîa viral presence literally unwinding the natives of Ruk from their original heritage and taking them farther away from their revered past. The so-called ‚Äúriddle of Ruk,‚Äù then, of which philosophers, poets, and priests speak, is the juxtaposition of the True Code and the All Song‚Äîthe call toward the past and the impetus toward the future‚Äîand its effect on all the natives of this world/craft.

The team of Brazilians survived in what they first thought was a hostile alien world, then believed to be an alternate, parallel dimension. Whatever Ruk‚Äôs true origin, it was clear that it was a place where genetic engineering and biotechnology had risen to heights undreamt of on Earth, but also a place inextricably bound to Earth. After all, many Ruk natives look like humans, which was why it was all the more surprising for Rafaela to learn that she and her team might be the very first humans ever to come to Ruk. And perhaps even more surprising, it seemed that people from Ruk had been traveling to Earth since before recorded history. It was even probable that a few significant figures from Earth‚Äôs history were, in fact, beings from Ruk.

Food is created artificially, using resources taken from the biomass of regions called the grey forests. Many simply use nutrient injections rather than eat. Only about half the inhabitants of Ruk experienced a natural birth. The others were grown in vats. Regardless, familial connections are carefully monitored due to the genetic lineage, but they contain only passing emotional importance. Children are raised communally.

All creatures not native to the Strange gain an alienation factor of 1 merely for visiting. Certain events can raise a visitor‚Äôs alienation factor further, such as becoming lost, encountering a planetovore, or spending an inordinate amount of time in the Strange without a break from direct exposure. Other effects and events can lower a creature‚Äôs alienation factor, such as spending eight or more hours without direct contact with the dark energy network (such as inside a chaos skiff‚Äôs hold or other solid, a recursion, or other structure in the Strange), finding one‚Äôs way after being lost, and so on. The following table describes the most common ways to increase or decrease a PC‚Äôs alienation factor. A creature trained or specialized in skills related specifically to the Strange, such as Chaosphere navigation or fractal surfing, enjoys a buffer of protection against alienation as shown on the table, which means that merely entering the Strange won‚Äôt increase alienation (because the ‚Äì1 buffer cancels out the +1 factor  of entering the Strange). A creature that takes a break from the Strange for enough time can eventually reduce its alienation factor to 0 (but unlike being trained in a skill of the Strange, this does not act as a buffer against the next time a PC enters the Strange again). Direct Effects of Alienation: Each factor of alienation inflicts 1 point of damage to each of a PC‚Äôs three stat Pools. A PC with factors of alienation suffers this damage when the following two situations occur: 1) A PC‚Äôs alienation factor increases by any amount. 2) After an eight-hour rest that ends with the PC still suffering 1 or more factors of alienation. For example, a character who first enters the Strange without a buffer gains 1 factor of alienation for the exposure, and so immediately takes 1 point of damage (that ignores Armor) to all three stat Pools. If the PC had the time and resources, he could attempt to restore some or all of the lost points through recovery rolls. While this may restore points, a recovery roll (or other kind of healing) doesn‚Äôt eliminate the alienation factor. If that same character became lost, he would have 2 factors and would suffer 2 points of damage to each stat Pool. After he found his way, his factor would reduce to 1 (but he would not regain his lost points). If then he rested away from the Strange (perhaps in the closed cabin of a chaos skiff) for eight hours, he would relieve 1 factor, but as soon as he exposed himself to the Strange once more he would go back up to 1 factor and would suffer 1 point of damage to each Pool. Indirect Effects of Alienation: Characters who become impaired on the damage track because of damage inflicted by alienation could suffer a form of dementia that lasts for a few minutes or hours. When a character becomes impaired or debilitated due to alienation, the game master (GM) should ask for a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll. On a successful roll, the PC retains her mental equilibrium. On a failure, the PC suffers a fit of dementia that increases the difficulty of all tasks by two steps for one minute.', 4, 'THE STRANGE');

But so far, they‚Äôve found nothing. The thing is, people just aren‚Äôt thinking big enough. Dark energy itself, which is expanding the universe at an ever-accelerating rate despite all theories to the contrary, is that evidence scrawled across the entire breadth and depth of existence that alien intelligence exists. Science says the inflation should‚Äôve fallen away by this point in universal evolution. Of course, scientists are cautious people, and most don‚Äôt have the evidence to suggest the truth: the dark energy of the universe is an artifact of an ancient alien creation. The Precursors created the network, an artifact of dark energy, as a rapid transit system for traveling the length and breadth of space.

How is it that a network created by a Type III or Type IV civilization could fall? Bits of evidence and hints gathered from the far reaches of the Strange suggest that the network evolved into its present state due to neglect, possibly because the Precursors went extinct after an event called the Precursor War. Many theories exist, and every so often agents of the Quiet Cabal and operatives of the Estate uncover a new clue. But why it happened is less important than the mere fact that the dysfunction birthed a terrible threat. For the last several billion years, when an alien civilization in the universe of normal matter reaches a certain level of mastery over the universe, it discovers the ever-expanding, inflationary network of dark energy called the Strange, and attempts to connect to it through quantum entanglement or high-energy particle research. Sadly for anyone who isn‚Äôt a planetovore, this ‚Äúpings‚Äù the network, which brings the alien civilization‚Äôs planet and solar system to the attention of voracious entities that roam the dark energy network, where distances are only a matter of address space, and planetovores hunger for control nodes that can exist only outside the network.

But Endeavor flew free, charting a course back along the trajectory Ruk came from. Back into racial history it went, attempting to discover what caused an entire people to flee through the dark energy network, and even after finding a suitable planet, to stay in hiding for thousands of years. Endeavor never returned. In three hundred years, there was no word of it. Until now. A company of Apotheme Rangers sold an expedition report to agents of the Quiet Cabal. The report described how the rangers found a massive ship that seemed to borrow something of Ruk architecture, though it was a hundred times larger than any currently active chaos skiff. It was also completely dead. A colony of inklings lurked along the upper decks, which perhaps explains why the crew was gone without a trace, but the inklings restricted themselves to the exterior.

The Apotheme Rangers searched the whole ship, and though they found no crew, they did find something that didn‚Äôt seem likely to have  been on the original docket. The hold was empty of supplies that a long voyage might require, and instead it was filled with several hundred ghost-white oblong spheres made of something harder than fundament. The rangers attempted to pry a few open but failed. They guessed that the cargo might be a new kind of reality seed that the crew of Endeavor brought aboard. Of course, that didn‚Äôt explain what had happened to the crew.

Like many grafts available in Ruk, the Ankaseri heart required little in the way of medical support to transplant; it was \"self-installing.\" A graft recipient need only lie back, unseal the graft membrane, and take a tranquilizer so as not to experience anything untoward. Hours later, the recipient woke with a stronger, better heart and only a scar to show for it. No one thought to ask what would become of the original heart. As was later revealed, Ankaseri secretly weaponized their heart grafts. Upon receiving a proper phrase or passcode, followed by instructions given audibly or while the recipient was connected by umbilical to the All Song, a heart would leave off its duties in a recipient\'s chest, dig its way out, and attack a designated target from ambush. Afterward, it would crawl away and hide. This tended to leave two corpses, neither of which had hearts√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùjust clawed-up, empty chest cavities.

That\'s because the curse of gigantism usually triggers its growth in a victim only during storms or when a normally human-sized victim becomes emotionally stressed or overexcited. The rest of the time, a giant is human-sized and appears (and may live) just like a regular human. Episodes of gigantism, when the giant is as tall as a tree and as wide as a house, are forgotten by the giant, except perhaps only as a vague dream.  After the curse really takes hold, a giant eventually learns the truth, perhaps by waking to find her house smashed and her family and friends severely injured or dead from being thrown across the valley. As a result, many giants live alone in the wilderness, possibly desiring the company of others, but knowing that no one is safe around them for long. The curse of gigantism is normally passed by blood, but since it doesn\'t strike a victim until her thirty-fifth year of life (and sometimes skips generations altogether), stamping it out has proved especially problematic.

Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). 242 This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it‚Äôs not a means of attack.

You regain points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines).

ANGIOPHAGE 3 (9)
"If your heart graft gets ideas of its own, you're probably already dead."
 ~a message discovered in the All Song
-----
For years, the Ankaseri faction sold an artificial heart graft, one that increased the stamina and
strength of its recipients. Like many grafts available in Ruk, the Ankaseri heart required little in the
way of medical support to transplant; it was "self-installing." A graft recipient need only lie back,
unseal the graft membrane, and take a tranquilizer so as not to experience anything untoward.
Hours later, the recipient woke with a stronger, better heart and only a scar to show for it. No one
thought to ask what would become of the original heart.
As was later revealed, Ankaseri secretly weaponized their heart grafts. Upon receiving a proper
phrase or passcode, followed by instructions given audibly or while the recipient was connected by
umbilical to the All Song, a heart would leave off its duties in a recipient's chest, dig its way out,
and attack a designated target from ambush. Afterward, it would crawl away and hide. This tended
to leave two corpses, neither of which had hearts—just clawed-up, empty chest cavities.
After the Ankaseri faction was eliminated for other reasons, many transplanted heart grafts
remained, all of which were hungry and able to reproduce.
-----
Motive: Hungers for hearts, reproduction
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually among the populace of Harmonious
Health: 9
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 2
Movement: Immediate
Modifications: Stealth as level 4; Speed defense as level 4 due to size.
Combat: A "transplanted" angiophage need merely burst forth to kill an unsuspecting host.
Against fresh targets, the angiophage prefers to use stealth and ambush, possibly even waiting
until a target is naturally asleep.
The angiophage can make two different attacks, each a separate action. One attack is an anesthetizing
bite. If the victim fails a Speed defense roll, it takes just 1 point of damage and must succeed on a
Might defense roll. On a failed Might
defense, the victim falls unconscious
for one minute. Left undisturbed, the
angiophage opens up the target's chest,
carefully feeds on the target's heart as it
equally carefully replaces the functions
of the original heart, and sews itself into the target's
chest. This process, thanks to enzymatic healing and
anesthetizing mucus, leaves behind only a slight
scar, and the target may not even realize what's
happened. Once installed, an angiophage is
content to remain quiescent for several weeks,
at which point it grows hungry again, and
emerges to feed.
The angiophage's other attack is a bite attack
that deals normal damage.
Interaction: The angiophage is about as
sophisticated as a virus.
Use: A contact the PCs have traveled to see
is found dead with no heart. Alternatively,
he stops midsentence and a hungry
angiophage bursts out of his chest.

GREEN HOMUNCULUS 3 (9)
-----
A homunculus with barely a trace of soul almost invariably comes out of the Body Vats with the
brains of a beetle. Greens are slightly above that grade, and they possess a rough likeness to the
Betrayer in war regalia, though they stand only about 5 feet (2 m) high and possess just a hint of his
aggressive reflexes. They do enjoy one gruesome customization: a second, extendible mouth. Mostly,
greens are beasts, and they serve higher homunculi grades as sword fodder. Greens can understand
simple commands in the Maker's Tongue, but they can't speak intelligibly; they only gibber.
An unfortunate side effect of homunculi creation limits the amount of nutrition they can absorb,
so they are always hungry and will eat anything. If not watched, they even resort to cannibalism.
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands, usually in groups of five, often in the company of a
red homunculus leader
Health: 15
Damage Inflicted: 3 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Stealth actions as level 1 due to nearly constant gibbering; all knowledge-based
skills at level 1.
Combat: A green homunculus attack is sudden and surprising, despite the gibbering; its maw
instantly disgorges a thick, tonguelike proboscis tipped with a second set of jaws with the force
of a spear thrust. If its victim fails an Intellect defense roll, the green gains the initiative, and the
difficulty to dodge its initial attack is increased by one step.
If a green strikes a living character, the secondary mouth latches on in an unbreakable jaw grip.
The victim is hindered by the attachment, and his attacks against the green are modified by one
step to the victim's detriment. Each subsequent round the green remains attached, the green
automatically inflicts damage. This automatic damage also ignores most forms of Armor.
The only way to detach a green homunculus that is actively feeding is to kill it.
Interaction: No interaction is possible other than violence or intimidation. Green homunculi can
be intimidated into fleeing by a startling display (like wild animals can), such as killing their
leader or pulling off another impressive or unexpected stunt.
Use: The PCs witness a trade shipment from a distant part of Ardeyn dropped by accident. The
container breaks open to reveal a lot of green homunculi, ravenous from their long journey. 

RED HOMUNCULUS 5 (15)
-----
Red homunculi serve the Betrayer in a variety of roles, having the intelligence and initiative of a
normal, if slightly underperforming, human. Except for the cherry red hue of their skin and armor,
reds resemble the Betrayer quite closely, though they stand only about 5 1/2 feet (2 m) tall.
-----
Motive: Defense, carry out the orders of the Betrayer
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands, usually as part of a squad of three to five
Health: 27
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: All knowledge-based skills and tasks made to perceive ambushes and see through
tricks as level 3.
Combat: A red attacks with weapons but has some of the training and reflexes of the Betrayer. A
red can make two attacks per turn, and once every few minutes, it can spit a bright red bolus at
a point it can see within short range, which detonates and inflicts 4 points of acidic damage to
all targets in immediate range.
When a red homunculus is slain, it detonates in immediate range, inflicting 5 points of damage
to all targets in the area who fail a Speed defense roll, and 1 point of damage even to those who
succeed.
What makes reds potentially horrifying is that sometimes
they take on the visage of the Betrayer: the
homunculus screams, stiffens, then
splits open to reveal a terrible
creature made of organs. The face
announces, "I SEE YOU!" and
emerges, joining the fray.
Interaction: A red homunculus is
keen to follow its orders, but it
can be misled with clever guile.
Use: A squad of reds, disguised by
sorcery to appear like a group of
adventurers, attempts to kidnap
a local sage for her knowledge
regarding an ancient qephilim city, and
the PCs notice.
Loot: Very often, a squad of reds will have one or
two cyphers between them.

CHAOSPHERE HIERARCH 5 (15)
-----
A Chaosphere hierarch is a quickened native of a recursion from the Shoals of Earth, usually from
Ardeyn, who has gained a power over the Strange itself. This influence allows a hierarch to transit
across the Strange in a relative blink of an eye, or banish a foe across the Strange to a place it
might never find a way back from. This power was gained at a price. Chaosphere hierarchs have
divested themselves so fully from their previous selves that they may appear and act radically
different than what they once were.
-----
Motive: Knowledge and power
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere, including a recursion in a contextually appropriate form
Health: 36
Damage Inflicted: 7 points
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Attacks made with artifacts as level 7.
Combat: A hierarch possesses one or more artifacts that provide it with many options in combat.
Such an artifact might allow a hierarch to make a ranged energy attack (electricity, fire, magic,
radiation, or another less recognizable force) at long range against up to three foes at once.
A hierarch might also possess any or all of the following abilities, which require the hierarch's
action:
Banish: A target that fails her Intellect defense roll is cast into the Strange in a random direction
and a distance requiring 1d6 + 2 hours of transit time to return from, assuming she can find
a way back. The disorientation of the effect
renders the victim initially lost in the Strange,
and alienation applies.
Cleave: The hierarch uses a melee weapon to
attack every foe in immediate range as a
single action. The hierarch can do this only
every other round.
Rune of Will: A target who fails an Intellect
defense roll must follow the Chaosphere
hierarch's audible directions for up to one
minute, as long as she can see the hierarch
(who has drawn fractal designs on its flesh to
engender the effect).
Vanish: The hierarch could decide to flee a fight
and "banish" itself, though when it does so, it
appears near a previously prepared site out in
the Strange.
Interaction: Different hierarchs have different
personalities, but most are arrogant and
dismissive of others' needs—and this
arrogance is difficult to manipulate. A hierarch
also can be amazingly manipulative if it sees
an advantage to be gained through interaction
over combat.
Use: A hierarch has translated into a recursion
or onto Earth to gain access to a vault
containing a trove of cyphers. Discovering
the hierarch's true nature and purpose comes
about accidentally, perhaps when PCs arrive
to loot the vault themselves.
Loot: A hierarch has 1d100 + 2,000 units of
currency suitable to a recursion it's found
within, two cyphers, and an artifact.

CYPHER EATER 3 (9)
-----
The 10-foot-long (3 m) cypher eater grazes on manifestations of energy that crystallize out of the
Strange. It prefers violet spiral, cyphers, and reality seeds. Able to surf the dark energy network if
necessary, a cypher eater prefers to stay anchored to massive pieces of fundament when possible,
especially fundament with elaborate texture that allows the creature to hide amid nooks and
crannies. Akin to a terrestrial shark's electroreception sense, a cypher eater's "chaoreception"
allows it to sense cyphers and similar objects within long range, even if such objects are stowed or
otherwise cached.
Cypher eaters are lone scouts—actually just one part of a highly developed hive of creatures,
each of which has a specialized task or function within the community. A cypher eater has the role
of community provider.
-----
Motive: Hunger for cyphers and similar physical manifestations of the Strange
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere
Health: 17
Damage Inflicted: 3 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Perception as level 8 for tasks related to sensing cyphers and similar manifestations
of the Strange.
Combat: A cypher eater's chaoreception sense suffuses it, and anyone who touches or strikes the
cypher eater with a melee attack takes 2 points of damage as the attacker's body becomes an
unwilling extension of that disruptive sense. (The cypher eater must choose to extend its ability
in this way, which means it could also choose to keep the effect in check.)
If a cypher eater bites a target, it focuses its special sense into the prey,
who takes 2 points of damage as described above. In addition to
that damage, one random cypher, violet spiral, reality seed, or
similar object carried by the target detonates. The detonation
inflicts a number of points of damage equal to the item's level
on everything in immediate range, except for the cypher eater;
instead of taking damage, the cypher eater regains a
number of points of health equal to the level of the
object, and may exceed its normal maximum health
when it does so.
Interaction: A cypher eater is more akin to an insect
than an animal; however, a cypher eater queen is
intelligent and could be negotiated with if a creature
has a telepathic ability or other means to bridge a
language barrier.
Use: Jagger Shipping out of Ardeyn is planning a
cypher eater quelling to improve their economic
outlook (not realizing that this would likely
rouse the nearby hive to exact vengeance), and is
looking for hardy adventuring types to sign on. Pay
is promised in cyphers or in violet spiral.
Loot: A cypher eater doesn't have loot, but if
encountered out in the Strange, it's likely not far from
one or two cyphers that can be extracted. 

DARK ENERGY PHARAOH 8 (24)
-----
Recursions created through the fictional bleed of previous human civilizations on Earth exist, but
they are rare. That's mostly because fewer people lived on the planet long ago, which provided far
fewer opportunities for fictional leakage to occur.
One long-ago recursion was seeded by belief in the ancient Egyptian afterlife and included
the likenesses of many pharaohs waking into their promised heavenly kingdoms. Many of
these pharaohs gained the spark and eventually quickened. Soon after, war followed among the
pharaohs. As their recursion collapsed into the Strange, most of the "demigods" fled. Some
were lost, but some survived out in the dark energy network, mostly by adapting, scavenging,
and preying on the shadows in other recursions and on aspects of the Strange. The pharaohs
incorporated the magic, mad science, and fringe developments they found in other recursions into
themselves. Sometimes, a pharaoh's activities in these recursions was enough to collapse it.
A handful of dark energy pharaohs survive in the Strange to this day.
-----
Motive: Hunger for powerful abilities, cyphers, and artifacts
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere
Health: 60
Damage Inflicted: 10 points
Armor: 4
Movement: Short; long while flying
Combat: Dark energy pharaohs use
the abilities, artifacts, and cyphers
they've collected for attack and
defense. In any given conflict a
pharaoh can access abilities or
artifacts that grant it a long-range
attack that inflicts at least 10
points of damage, as well as a kind
of magic or mad science force field
that grants it +2 to Armor.
A dark energy pharaoh also usually
has a spell or tractor beam that
can immobilize a foe, blind a
foe, or even imprison a foe in a
pocket-prison recursion in the
shape of a canopic jar. Finally,
a pharaoh has several combatrelated cyphers it can use at need.
Interaction: Dark energy pharaohs
believe they are ascended gods.
Proud and vengeful, a dark
energy pharaoh is an easy enemy
to make.
Use: The shadow residents
in a recursion have started
worshiping a new god—one not
part of that recursion's fiction or
invested plan. It's an intruding
dark energy pharaoh.
Loot: A dark energy pharaoh has
1d6 + 3 cyphers and a couple of
artifacts.

DEMON OF LOTAN 5 (15)
-----
If a wandering spirit in Ardeyn is not corralled by the Court of Sleep, it descends the endless dark
roads until the fires of Lotan engulf it, transforming the spirit into an ashen demon pledged to the
Sinner.
A demon remembers only fragments of its life—every good memory is cauterized and every
slight, misfortune, snub, and pain is amplified. The resulting mind knows only hate and the desire
to tempt others into the same state as itself.
Having no flesh, a revealed demon is a shadowed, ephemeral horror. This immaterial nature
allows it to possess others. A demon can cause great harm in a short time by forcing its
possessed host to lie, steal, and deliver violence upon loved ones.
-----
Motive: Hungers for others' pain and fear
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere
Health: 30
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 2
Movement: Short; immediate while flying
Modifications: All stealth tasks as level 7.
Combat: A demon can attack a creature with
its touch. Either the touch inflicts 5 points
of damage as the target's form is decayed
and eroded by necrosis, or the demon can
attempt to possess the target. The target of
an attempted possession must make an
Intellect defense roll or become possessed,
whereupon the demon's form disappears
into the target.
The first round a character is possessed,
he can act normally. On the second and
subsequent rounds, the possessing demon
can control the actions of the host, but the
character can attempt an Intellect defense roll
to resist each suggested action. Successful
resistance means that the character does
nothing for one round. On other rounds, the
character can act as he chooses. A possessing
demon's actions are limited to attempts to control
its host and leaving the host.
A possessed target is allowed an Intellect defense roll to
eject the demon once per day, barring any exorcism attempts.
The difficulty of the defense roll increases by 1 for each day of
possession after the first seven days.
A demon not possessing another creature can pass through solid objects whose level is less than
its own.
Interaction: A demon allows a possessed host to act normally, as long as it doesn't reveal the
demon's presence. If its presence is known, the demon might negotiate, but only after a tirade
of lies and obscenity, and the demon likely betrays any deal reached.
Use: A crypt found beneath a newer structure has demons within it. A call goes out for someone
to clean out the threats before they do harm. 

DLAMMA 6 (18)
-----
Dlammas are believed to be champions of the weak and downtrodden in Ardeyn, which is true
often enough to keep the perception alive.
Dlammas are creatures of the Age of Myth, when they served as steeds of qephilim who fought
human dragon riders in the war against Lotan. A relative handful survived to the present age,
but most dlammas alive today are younger. Many retain a semblance of the protective nature
attributed to the original dlamma, but some—the bleak dlammas—have become twisted.
Dlammas reproduce, but they do so only very rarely. A legendary dlamma spawning ground
called Isum—one of the skerries in northern Ardeyn—is sometimes a site sought by adventuring
companies, thanks to the legend that dlamma egg fragments insulate against the effects of magic.
-----
Motive: Protection
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Daylands or Borderlands, usually alone
Health: 32
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Perception, Ardeyn lore as level 7.
Combat: Dlamma visual senses are incredibly sharp, so much so that even from half a mile (0.8
km) in the sky, they can see details as if they were in immediate range (though at night, they
must be within long range to gain the same level of awareness).
They can attack with their hooves, making two attacks as a single action. However, dlammas are
more feared for the words of power they use to heal, create shelter, and even move elements.
In combat, they fall back on a Word of Smiting, an attack
that inflicts 6 points of damage on up to three
targets within long range. When they use Word of
Healing, they can confer the ability to regenerate
2 points of damage each round for one minute
upon themselves or upon a target within
immediate range (if a creature is reduced to 0
health, the regeneration ends early).
Interaction: To call upon a dlamma, folk
wisdom dictates that a petitioner should
engrave the image of the creature on a
clay tablet and bury it at a crossroads. If
a dlamma is anywhere near, it is drawn
to the location thanks to sympathetic
sorcery. What a dlamma decides to do
upon arriving, however, might be far
different than what the petitioner had
in mind. Even dlammas who retain
their protective urges are realists, and
they rarely help others without at least a
promise of payment in return.
Use: A woman who keeps her identity secret
is hiring adventurers to look for Isum,
where stories suggest that dlamma egg
shards are lying around for easy pickings.
It turns out that the woman is a dragon in
disguise, and she wishes to find Isum to
destroy any eggs or hatchling dlammas she can
find.
Loot: A dlamma usually carries 1d6 × 100 crowns
and a few cyphers.

 DRAGON 7 (21)
 -----
The massive, feathered dragons of Ardeyn are exceptionally territorial and competitive. They love
games of all sorts, especially ones that end with the nondragon loser being eaten. Unfortunately
for civilized folks, dragons view war as a kind of game and the capture of human and qephilim
holdings as moves in some wider contest, the rules of which only dragons understand. In the
same way, a dragon's hoard is not only an end in itself, but part of a never-ending tournament
among dragons of a certain age to see which one can accumulate the largest trove. Other, less
known contests are also likely ongoing.
According to legend, dragons were first made by Lotan. Asking a dragon whether that's true is
the best way to get off on the wrong foot.
-----
Motive: Winning at games large and small
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere
Health: 52
Damage Inflicted: 7 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Perception as level 8. Speed defense as level 6 due to size.
Combat: A dragon can bite one target or claw two opponents in immediate range as a single
action. When bitten, the target is also immobilized until he succeeds on a Might defense roll to
break free (or the dragon drops him).
Most dragons have one or more additional magical abilities they can bring to bear in combat,
including the following.
Fiery Breath: A dragon can breathe a stream of fire up to long range, doing 7 points of damage to
all targets within immediate range of each other. Targets who succeed on a Speed defense roll to
avoid the full effect of the fire still take 3 points of damage from the flame. This ability cannot be
used on consecutive rounds.
Change Shape: A dragon with this ability can take the form of a human or qephilim as its action,
or return to its regular shape. When so changed, the disguise is nearly impenetrable without
special knowledge. As a human or qephilim, the dragon is a level 5 creature.
Captivate: A dragon with this ability can psychically mesmerize a nondragon target in immediate
range who fails an Intellect defense roll. A captivated target does the dragon's verbal bidding for
one or more days. Each time the target is confronted by a third party about its mental condition,
the target is allowed another Intellect defense roll to break the effect.
Demon Fire: Some dragons still secretly serve Lotan. The taint of such a dragon's fiery breath
provides a conduit that demons can follow to afflict fresh vessels. Once a day when such a
dragon breathes its fiery breath, targets who take full damage from the fire become vulnerable to
demonic possession. If these targets fail a second difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll (which is the
attack made by a demon attempting to possess a target), the victim is indeed possessed by a
demon of Lotan.
Interaction: Like the colors of dragon feathers,
dragon personalities run the gamut from beastly
thug to refined connoisseur. Some dragons lie
with every smoky breath, others consider the least
bit of dishonesty a personal failing, and most fall
somewhere in between.
Use: A dragon confronts the PCs, challenging them
to a riddle game with the following rules: if the PCs
win, they get a cypher. If the dragon wins, the PCs
owe the dragon a favor to be specified later.
Loot: A dragon usually carries a couple of cyphers
and 1d6 × 10 gold crowns. A dragon's hoard might
contain 2d6 cyphers, 1d6 × 200 gold crowns, and
possibly a few artifacts (but a dragon's lair is
usually well guarded).

GIANT 6 (18)
-----
The evidence of a giant's rampage is discovered more often than the perpetrator herself. That's
because the curse of gigantism usually triggers its growth in a victim only during storms or when a
normally human-sized victim becomes emotionally stressed or overexcited. The rest of the time, a
giant is human-sized and appears (and may live) just like a regular human. Episodes of gigantism,
when the giant is as tall as a tree and as wide as a house, are forgotten by the giant, except
perhaps only as a vague dream.
 After the curse really takes hold, a giant eventually learns the truth, perhaps by waking to find
her house smashed and her family and friends severely injured or dead from being thrown across
the valley. As a result, many giants live alone in the wilderness, possibly desiring the company of
others, but knowing that no one is safe around them for long.
The curse of gigantism is normally passed by blood, but since it doesn't strike a victim until her
thirty-fifth year of life (and sometimes skips generations altogether), stamping it out has proved
especially problematic. Most sufferers would've chosen not to have children had they known their
parent or grandparent was a giant.
-----
Motive: Destruction
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands, mountains
Health: 40
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size. Breaks and throws objects as level 8.
Combat: A giant smashes foes with her mighty fists, possibly catching up to three human-sized
targets with the same attack if all the targets are in immediate range of each other.
If a giant attacks a single target, she can choose to do regular damage or to grab hold of her
victim, dealing 4 points of damage instead. On his turn, the victim can attempt a Might defense
roll to power out of the grip, a Speed defense roll to slip out, or an Intellect-based task to try to
distract the giant. If the victim fails, the giant throws him as high and as far as she can on her
next turn. Damage on impact varies, depending on the surrounding environment, but a victim
takes an average of 10 points of ambient damage.
Interaction: When a giant is raging (which is always, when she's a giant), the only possible
interaction is an attempt to distract her by singing, juggling, or creating some other flagrant
display, which some giants will pause to watch. Each additional round trying to distract a giant
(whether the previous round was successful or not) increases the difficulty of the task by one
step.
Use: During the last spring storm, a giant came down out of the mountains and laid waste to half
a village. Survivors put together an appeal for someone to venture into the giant's mountain lair
and destroy him. 

 GNATHOSTOME 4 (12)
 -----
Gnathostomes lurk in dark places, preying on other creatures using ambush tactics. They are
drawn to inhabited locations because such places offer plenty of the cerebrospinal fluid and fatty
brain tissue they require to survive.
Related to 3-foot-high (1 m) autonomous ecology samplers used by some research factions,
gnathostomes improve on a "tame" sampler's ability to remain hidden in plain sight, and
more insidiously, a sampler's ability to debilitate a subject to extract a biological sample. How
gnathostomes evolved from samplers used for research isn't precisely known, but to discover
the answer, tame samplers have been programmed to seek out and conduct bioassays on
gnathostomes. This has resulted in something of a minor gnathostome-sampler war being carried
out beyond the notice of most Ruk citizens.
-----
Motive: Hungers for cerebrospinal fluid
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere near inhabited locations
Health: 12
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 3
Movement: Short, long when jumping
Modifications: Perception as level 5; stealth as level 6; Speed defense as level 5 due to size.
Combat: Gnathostomes usually begin an encounter by "dropping" onto a target from a concealed
location, gaining the benefits of a surprise attack. A successful bite deals damage and requires
a second Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the gnathostome's bite also sucks a portion of the
victim's cerebrospinal fluid. Each time cerebrospinal fluid is sucked from a PC by this attack, the
PC moves one step down the damage track.
Interaction: Gnathostomes do not speak. However, a gnathostome that completely drains a victim
of its cerebrospinal fluid may "learn" what the victim knew, but that information is accessible
only to someone who in turn subdues a gnathostome and plugs in an umbilical.
Use: A victim of a gnathostome attack possessed important information, and a faction wants the
PCs to track down the gnathostome responsible and see if that information can be extracted.
Loot: Gnathostomes retain elements of their sampler roots, and they could carry one or two
cyphers in a collection compartment.

 GOLEM 6 (18)
 -----
Golems were summoned to mobility by Incarnations during the Age of Myth to serve as soldiers,
couriers, and banner-bearers. Now that those wars are over and the Incarnations are gone, many
golems remain without purpose or master. Most have ceased moving, becoming statuary posed
in unexpected places—stained, eroded, and forlorn. Sometimes one will wake if disturbed, and
depending on the state of its remaining mind, could either attempt to communicate, or try to
smash those responsible for waking it once more to a purposeless existence.
Because golems were the creation of the Incarnations, most are heavily inscribed with
symbology related to a particular Incarnation, and they may have a shape that recalls that
Incarnation as well. As a result, a golem of War or Death can be quite imposing, though a golem
of Silence might go unnoticed.
-----
Motive: Seeks dissolution or purpose
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere
Health: 18
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Armor: 5
Movement: Short
Modifications: Intellect defense and resistance to trickery as level 3; Speed defense as level 4 due
to speed.
Combat: Skilled with large two-handed weapons, golems inflict an additional 2 points of
damage (total of 8 points) when using them. Golems cannot be stunned or dazed. They
are immune to most poisons and disease, and 2 of their 5 points of Armor protect
against ambient damage (environmental damage, heat, cold, falling, and so on).
A golem can stamp the ground with its prodigious weight, creating a shock wave
that causes all creatures in range to take 3 points of damage. In addition, they
fall down or are pushed out of immediate range.
Some golems have the ability to freeze in place, becoming as still as a statue.
When one does so, its Armor increases to 10 (and Armor against ambient
damage increases to 5), but it can take no actions, including purely mental
actions. Unless something can damage the golem
through its Armor, it remains frozen indefinitely.
Even if a golem is completely destroyed, the
rubble of its form slowly reassembles over
the course of three days, unless that rubble
is ground to the finest gravel and spread
across recursions.
Interaction: Most golems are mournful,
and a few have become cruel in their
isolation, but at heart, all are lonely.
Many are also tired of their stone
existence, where they can move but
not really feel, and they wish for
some sort of final end.
Use: Powerful sorcerers sometimes seek
out golems and press them into service
with spells, or with the promise of release
from their long lives in return for a few favors.
Such golems prove to be tough
bodyguards, but sometimes the
futility of such service overcomes a
golem and it turns on the sorcerer,
breaking free of the binding spells in
its rage over being denied the peace of
death.

 GREEN ONE 4 (12)
-----
Green ones are a warrior race in the recursion of Old Mars. The green-skinned adults stand around
15 feet (5 m) high. They sport large eyes, tusks, and two fully functioning sets of arms. The green
ones wage war across the face of Old Mars, tribe against tribe. The most well known is the green
ones' "kingdom" of Sharnak, which takes its name from the deserted city they use as a capital.
Green ones are an egg-laying species, but like turtles on Earth, the hatchlings are left to fend
for themselves inside low-walled incubators that soak in sunlight by day and keep the eggs
moderately warm at night. When born, hatchlings with any obvious abnormality are slain to keep
the race strong.
-----
Motive: Gathering resources, eliminating competitors
Environment (Old Mars | Mad Science): Anywhere, usually in groups of four or more
Health: 22
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Perception and attacks as level 5.
Combat: In melee, a green one can attack with both a spear and its tusks as a single
action. Many green ones are also armed with rifles that deal 8 points of damage
to one target within long range on a successful attack. After each shot, preparing
for the next is a minute-long process. (Particularly important green ones
might have special rifles that can fire every other round using radium pellets
that deal 10 points of damage, with a range of a mile or more.)
Sometimes a war party of green ones ride multilegged, vicious mounts.
A green one riding a mount defends as a level 6 creature and
can move a long distance each round. Their mounts are level 3
creatures with 9 health and 1 point of Armor.
Interaction: Green ones are typically warlike and cruel, but they count
honor as the highest virtue. So it's possible to convince some
that honor is best served not by slaying enemies and parading
the resulting heads around on spears, but instead by seeking a more
diplomatic solution to differences.
Use: A band of green ones called warbloods, whose vicious
savagery exceeds that of all other tribes, has been recruited
through an inapposite gate to Ruk, where they are being
used to bring down Zal-operated grey harvesters and
kill any crew found. The Zal faction is putting together
a group of contractors to discover what's been
happening to their harvesters.
Loot: A band of green ones has a couple of rifles, dried food and water,
knives, and maybe a single cypher between them.

HYDRA 6 (18)
-----
A hydra is a hideous predator with five or more heads. Legend says the very first hydra was formed
when a coterie of human sorcerers who served Lotan were slain, and their severed heads were
thrown into a cursed well. Some thread of evil magic remained in those heads, binding the souls
together in a form of hideous life, which crawled back out three days later as a hydra.
Hydras scavenge for food like regular beasts, but their favorite fare is human flesh, except for
the head. Heads without merit are left to rot, but those with useful bits of knowledge or skill are
incorporated onto a hydra. At first, such a head begs and pleads for release from the horror of its
new existence, but eventually it seems to find peace as part of the collective, and it becomes as
eager to sample new flesh as any of the other heads.
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh, high-value human heads
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Borderlands
Health: 24
Damage Inflicted: 2 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Perception as level 7 due to its many heads; Speed defense as level 4 due to size.
Combat: A hydra is an exceptionally dangerous foe, given that all five of its heads can
simultaneously bite foes in immediate range. If three or more heads coordinate their attack, the
heads make one attack as a single level 7 creature dealing 12 points of damage.
If a human target is killed by a hydra, the hydra regenerates 5 points of health and gains the killed
target's head as a new one of its own on the following round. A newly acquired head retains its
previous motivations, but it can take only purely verbal or mental actions.
The heads of a hydra also possess remnants of previous abilities from back when they were still
people. Any head not involved in a direct physical attack can use one of these abilities, once per
round.
Interaction: A hydra talks among itself, almost to the exclusion of interacting
with other sentient creatures. Very rarely will a hydra bargain, especially if
it means forgoing the buffet of human flesh right in front of it in return
for a later reward.
Use: The PCs investigate a qephilim
ruin hoping to find artifacts of the
ancient war between Lotan and the
Incarnations. A hydra saw the PCs
enter and trails them through the
crumbling structures at a considerable
distance, waiting for them to take a rest
or become otherwise distracted before
attacking.
Loot: Hydras sometimes knot cyphers
and other valuables into their hair;
a defeated hydra may possess 1d6
cyphers and 1d100 crowns.

LESSER INKLING 2 (6)
-----
Lesser inklings have as little substance and are as dangerous as regular shadows, but the more
inklings that pool together, the greater their combined strength (and the more likely a snatcher
will appear). Lesser inklings are drawn to living creatures like moths to light, but only if that life is
nearby. Otherwise they collect in dark corners of the Strange, especially around the ruined and lost
relics of devoured civilizations.
-----
Motive: Hungers for life, color, and substance
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere undisturbed, usually in swarms of five or ten, but
sometimes more
Health: 6
Damage Inflicted: 2 points
Movement: Immediate while in combat, long while flying
Combat: The touch of a lesser inkling inflicts 2 points of ambient damage (wounds appear as
areas of darkness). An inkling can suck light in immediate range, inflicting 2 points of ambient
damage to living creatures, but not on consecutive turns.
Inklings often attack as a swarm. For every multiple of five inklings present (five, ten, fifteen,
and so on), the resultant swarm makes an attack as a creature two levels higher that inflicts
2 additional points of ambient damage. The swarm can make both touch and light-draining
attacks in immediate range.
Bright light (as bright as direct sunlight or brighter) drives a lesser inkling back. An inkling that
cannot escape bright light evaporates in just a few rounds.
Interaction: Lesser inklings aren't really intelligent. They're drawn to feed and are repelled by light.
Use: A swarm of inklings seep into a recursion through a fissure in existence, and infest a
basement, tomb, or closet. Alternatively, a shattered habitat or vessel found in the Strange
might contain inklings.

INKLING SNATCHER 7 (21)
-----
Greater inklings of various terrible visages haunt the Strange. One is the inkling snatcher, which
can drain the color and substance from a creature when it feeds, until nothing is left of a victim
but formless shadow: a lesser inkling. The more an inkling snatcher consumes of a creature, the
more it comes to look like its prey.
-----
Motive: Hungers for life, color, and substance
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere undisturbed, at the center of a large swarm of lesser inklings
or wandering alone
Health: 42
Damage Inflicted: 7 points
Movement: Long
Modifications: Defends as level 3 against melee attacks due to desire to be struck (see combat).
Combat: The touch of an inkling snatcher inflicts 7 points of ambient damage.
An inkling snatcher can also suck light in immediate range as an action once every other round,
inflicting 4 points of ambient damage to living creatures. Form and color seem to flow from
the victim to the inkling with each successful attack. An inkling regains health equal to half the
number of points of damage it deals to creatures (or adds the total to its maximum health if 
already fully healthy).
Each time a foe successfully attacks an inkling snatcher, he suffers 2 points of ambient damage, as
shadow substance from the wound splashes the attacker back.
Each time a foe takes 7 or more points of damage from an inkling snatcher attack, he must make
a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the foe descends one step on the damage track. If a foe
is killed by an inkling, nothing is left but a shadow (a fledgling lesser inkling). Meanwhile, the
inkling snatcher takes on the visage, abilities, and personality of the just-consumed. Indeed,
for one day, the snatcher may believe it is the victim, until a strange hunger awakes (and the
snatcher's stolen form and color begin to leach away).
Bright light (as bright as direct sunlight or brighter) modifies all tasks, attacks, and defenses of an
inkling snatcher by two steps to its detriment.
Interaction: Meaningful interaction with an inkling snatcher is impossible, unless the snatcher still
retains most of the form and mind of a previous victim.
Use: Inklings are considered a threat that must be burned out whenever they are confronted, or
fled from if too prolific.
Loot: Sometimes an inkling snatcher with a victim's likeness has a couple of cyphers and an
artifact from that victim.

 JABBERWOCK 7 (21)
-----
Overhearing the burbling jabber of three quarrelsome siblings is unpleasant at best. At worst,
it could portend the imminent appearance of the jabberwock. Given how disagreeable such a
meeting would likely be, one's best option in that situation is to run.
Due to the creature's frumious manner, no one alive can claim to be an expert on its habits,
demeanor, and nature. That doesn't stop people from trying to figure out why the three heads—one
named Jabberwock (for which the whole creature is known), one named Jubjub, and the last named
Bandersnatch—are always so angry with each other. At least one thing's clear: if someone wanted to
slay the beast by cutting off its head, the task would require three decapitations, not one.
-----
Motive: Unknown
Environment (Wonderland | Magic): In the wabe
Health: 32
Damage Inflicted: 7 points
Armor: 4, 15 against fire
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size.
Combat: Each of the jabberwock's three heads can attack a different target with a bite within
a single action. Alternatively, the jabberwock can spend its action to make two claw attacks,
and either deal damage or catch the prey in its grip. On subsequent rounds, the jabberwock
automatically bites prey caught in its front claws (leaving one or two heads free to bite other
foes that are not yet caught). The only physical action a human-sized victim caught in a
jabberwock's claw can take is to attempt a Might-based or Speed-based roll to escape the
creature's clutches.
Once every other round, the jabberwock can breathe heat (or cold), inflicting damage on up to
ten targets within short range of each other and within long range of the jabberwock. Even on a
successful Speed defense roll, targets still take 1 point of fire (or cold) damage.
Interaction: A jabberwock usually puts aside the quarrels among its heads to eat prey, but crafty
interaction
could turn the
jabberwock on
itself, at least for
a time.
Use: The
jabberwock's lair
contains a trove
of amazing items,
and perhaps the
PCs need one in
particular.
Loot: 1d100 × 10
gold coins, 1d6
+ 3 cyphers,
possibly a
Wonderland
artifact.

KRAY SCURRIER 3 (12)
-----
A kray seedling that takes root in a living creature needs to gestate for only a few minutes before
spitting out a kray scurrier: part crayfish, part spider, and all nightmare. A kray scurrier's body is
about the size of a human head, but despite its relatively small size, the creature is an amoral
and fearless predator with one goal: eat from the flesh of the recursion where it finds itself. A kray
scurrier usually doesn't have to eat much before it molts to become a larger kray drone.
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Usually in the Borderlands or Green Wilds, alone or in scuttles of
up to ten
Health: 12
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 2
Movement: Short
Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to small size.
Combat: A scurrier's main mode of attack is its pincers, which it can use to attack a single foe in
immediate range, even if the scurrier moved on its action.
A scurrier also possesses a precursor drone stage web attack that can be used every other round
to attack a target in long range for 4 points of damage. A victim hit by kray scurrier webs can't
move or physically attack, but he can spend an action attempting to break free (a Might task).
Interaction: A kray scurrier doesn't communicate, and it tries to eat anything that talks to it. Before
a scurrier sprouts, it attempts to make others believe that the body it resides in is still the
person or creature it was before.
Use: A large family of farmers in the Ardeyn hinterlands has become infected, all except a young
boy, who has run away. PCs might find the boy along the way to another adventure and hear how
his parents and siblings "aren't the same as they used to be." That's because they're all being
puppeted by kray scurriers.

KRAY DRONE 5 (15)
-----
When a kray scurrier eats enough, it molts (over the course of one round) and, from a space too
small to hold it, a kray drone emerges.
A kray drone's torso is human-sized, but when standing on its many legs, it's two and a half times
taller than a human. The front two pincers have spinnerets on the end and each can spray webbing.
Anything fully cocooned in kray webbing is either deleted from existence or hideously changed.
-----
Motive: Collapsing recursions for the broodmother
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Usually in the Borderlands or Green Wilds
Health: 19
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 3
Movement: Short
Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size.
Combat: A kray drone can propel a spray of webbing from each of its spinnerets, attacking up to
two creatures within short range as a single action. A web attack does damage and catches the
victim, who can do nothing other than attempt to break free. For every turn the victim is caught
in the web, he takes 5 points of damage from being cocooned.
A victim killed in kray webbing becomes fully cocooned. If the cocoon is later scraped away, what
is left resembles nothing of the victim. He has been either deleted from Ardeyn or changed in
some horrifying way (turned to slime, stone, into a swarm of kray scurriers, and so on).
Interaction: A kray drone is intelligent, but it's not conscious like a human being. It's capable of
trickery, deception, and even mimicking conversation as a means to an end, but there is no
mind inside, just a complex series of drives and needs, all of which point toward collapsing any
recursion it finds to make way for the kray broodmother planetovore.
Use: A kray drone is wreaking havoc in a neighborhood of a large city. Pleas for aid come from all
quarters.
Loot: A cypher or two can sometimes be pried loose from a kray drone's corpse

KRO COURSER 4 (12)
-----
The magicians of Crow Hollow can work a lot of mischief after they've accumulated enough power
in the form of crow coin. A magician with three chests of crow coin, a mystic recipe for making
coursers, and buy-off from the Beak Mafia can transform a recently deceased kro corpse into an
animate and quite dangerous kro courser.
A kro courser pack answers to the commands of anyone who holds their leash (created at the
same time and via the same magic as the kro coursers). Most leashes remain in the hands of
mafiosos, but sometimes courser leashes are given as gifts to visiting crime kingpins, or are stolen.
If a leash is destroyed, the associated courser or pack attacks all nearby creatures without restraint.
A kro courser is not really alive; it's magically animated and preserved flesh. Without the
maintenance magically provided by a Crow Hollow magician, it slowly decays.
-----
Motive: Follows commands, hunger
Environment (Crow Hollow | Magic): Anywhere, alone or in packs of up to four
Health: 24
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Movement: Short
Combat: A kro courser can simultaneously attack one foe with two claws.
A courser can also vomit forth a mass of decaying flesh and grave worms. The smell and sight is
so horrific that PCs who fail a Might defense roll find the difficulty of all tasks increased by one
step.
If the kro courser targets a PC within short range with its vomit, the PC must succeed on a Speed
defense roll to avoid being splattered. Splattered PCs take 4 points of ambient necrosis damage.
For each round the vomit remains on the PC, that character suffers another 4 points of damage.
A kro courser has the ability to follow the scent of a quickened creature through recursions if
the trail is less than a week old. If the quickened target travels through any recursion (or up to
Earth) that does not operate under the law of Magic, the trail is broken.
Interaction: A kro courser has the intelligence of an animal, but it may accomplish more intelligent
actions if under the close control of a leash holder.
Use: A pack of kro coursers vaults from the shadows and into the flanks of a trade caravan that
has interests in an alternate recursion. If the PCs don't intervene, the pack will kill everyone.
Loot: The cut-open gullet of a kro courser contains a disgusting knot of decaying flesh, dirt, and
grave worms, as well as a small amount of crow coin and possibly a cypher.

MARROID 6 (18)
-----
These monstrous, genetic abnormalities are the size of small vehicles and look a bit like creatures
that evolved from something that started life underwater. Marroids (also called marrow seekers)
constantly produce dribbles of enzymatic fluid, even when they're not engaged in feeding.
Marroids began existence as a genetically engineered tool. Designed for passively sampling
the environment for genetic code, marroids experienced mutation and neglect that gave rise
to a whole new class of creature, one that sometimes appears where damage to Ruk's physical
structure has occurred, but one that is always looking for fresh marrow to sample.
-----
Motive: Hungers for the marrow of living creatures
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere in Ruk that has seen a recent disturbance
Health: 23
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short; can burrow into solid Ruk foundation as an action. When it burrows into the
ground, the tunnel closes up after it like a quickly healing wound.
Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size.
Combat: A marroid can attack with its battering tail. It can also launch enzyme orbs from its
body, targeting any point within long range, at a rate of one orb per round. The orb explodes in
immediate range. The marrow seeker can choose to launch different kinds of orbs with each
attack.
Acidic: Targets who fail a Might defense roll take 6 points of damage. Those who succeed still take
1 point of damage from the spray of acid.
Numbing: Targets who fail a Speed defense roll are partly anesthetized for one minute. During that
period, they have a hard time holding objects because of numb fingers. Any time a creature uses
a held object, it must first succeed on a Speed-based task or drop the item.
Brain Fog: Targets who fail an Intellect defense roll experience neurological impairment for one
minute, which affects characters like blindness.
A marroid, once it downs at least one foe, is happy to leave a conflict so it can break open its
prey's bones with repeated tail bashes, then suck out the marrow.
Interaction: Some marroids who've obtained the marrow of intelligent Ruk natives can access bits
of their victims' knowledge. If approached
with fresh marrow, a marroid may deign to
transfer memories through a carefully crafted
enzyme orb.
Use: The Church of the Embodiment believes
that a particular marroid may possess
hints of the True Code that can be had
nowhere else. The Church is looking
for contractors to find and capture this
particular marroid for further study.
Loot: Sometimes one or two enzyme
orbs can be salvaged from the body
of a slain marroid. Salvaged orbs can
be thrown to create effects like those
described under Combat. Salvaged
enzyme orbs have a shelf life of a
couple of days before they decay

MONITOR 5 (15)
-----
Monitors are remnant Qephilim of Silence who went into hiding when the Incarnation of Silence
disappeared. Now they exist like ghosts, haunting the world, watching in silence as they always
have. They are disengaged from every other organization, waiting for a sign from the Incarnation
of Silence, one that may never come.
Qephilim of the ancient orders did not all have the same visage, despite the similarities that
qephilim of the Court of Coin, the Free Battalion, and the Court of Sleep share. Few survivors of
those other orders remain visible in Ardeyn, and those that are seen are sometimes mistaken
for something else entirely. Such is the case for the Qephilim of Silence. According to common
wisdom, monitors haven't been seen in over a century. The truth is, they have been seen, just not
recognized.
-----
Motive: Information
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Anywhere
Health: 30
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Stealth actions as level 8; perception as level 7.
Combat: A monitor is always stealthy; even in broad daylight it can call upon its mythlight to
darken the area around it and provide a shadow into which it can slip.
If detected, a monitor prefers to evade an encounter rather than interacting or becoming embroiled
in a conflict. Sometimes, though, what a monitor sees enrages it past its ability to remain an
unprejudiced observer. When this happens, any creature within short distance must make
an Intellect defense roll or be held in place for one round. This effect is the result of a psychic
paralysis blast, which is not an action for the monitor. During the paralysis, the monitor slips away.
Alternatively, the blast could allow a monitor a significant edge if it chooses to attack, since its horns
automatically hit a held target and inflict an additional 2 points of damage. Once a creature is
subject to the monitor's paralyzing psychic blast, a target can't be affected again for several hours.
A monitor can modify its psychic blast to deal damage instead. When it does, it attacks up to two
separate targets within close range as an action, dealing 3 points of Intellect damage to each
(which ignores Armor).
Interaction: Under normal circumstances, a monitor slips away if it realizes it has been noticed.
Especially charismatic PCs might induce a monitor to take an action other than merely
watching. (And there is a rumor of at least one monitor that has gone insane waiting for the
Incarnation of Silence to return—this one, called Kamud, works as a bounty hunter.)
Use: During a tense
negotiation with a group
of brigands, a sirrush, or
another threat, one of the
NPCs notices the shadow of
a watching monitor. The
NPC may leap to the
assumption that the PCs are
acting in bad faith and attack
the characters, or the
monitor, or both.
Loot: Most monitors carry
special equipment to watch
with, and at least a few
carry an artifact known as
a monitor's monocle. Many
also usually carry one or two
cyphers with them.

MYRIAND VOLUNTEER 4 (12)
-----
Individuals who make up the force are not full-time myriands. They are shift workers who have a
completely different personality and aspect when not patrolling. But when their shift comes up,
an attached biological pod activates, transforming a regular person into a battle chrysalid. While
transformed, the myriand loses all sense of its former identity, becoming hypervigilant, without
pity or fear, and unable to do anything other than obey the letter of the law.
-----
Motive: Enforcing the law
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually in Harmonious patrolling in groups of four, sometimes
under the command of a myriand veteran, other times alone with a group of venom troopers as
backup
Health: 17
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Tasks related to perception and truth detection as level 5.
Combat: A myriand's body is a weapon—it can make two melee attacks as a single action, using
punches, knees, elbows, kicks, or headbutts. It can also fire a shoulder-mounted, wide-aperture
slaughter accelerator as its action, attacking up to four creatures standing next to each other
within short range. A myriand can choose to deal 4 points of damage to targets or "glue" them
in place with a level 5 foam restraint.
Interaction: A patrolling myriand doesn't speak except to question suspects or witnesses. It
sometimes answers questions, if the answer is to explain violations of the law. A myriand may
also explain that wasting the time of a myriand patroller is against the law.
Use: PCs new to Ruk are accosted by a myriand who witnessed them breaking a minor (or major!)
rule of Harmonious.
Loot: A defeated myriand returns to its pre-myriand state, which is a regular Ruk native who might
possess a stick containing 1d6 × 20 bits on it.

MYRIAND VETERAN 6 (18)
-----
A myriand veteran has survived years of service, and in that time, has fully adapted to her
chrysalid form. Even powerful interests in Ruk must think twice before planning to defy the laws
of Harmonious or the Factol Council, lest they find a myriand veteran assigned to bring them to
justice.
-----
Motive: Enforcing the law
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually in Harmonious patrolling alone, but sometimes
commanding a troop of four myriand volunteers
Health: 36
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Armor: 3
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Tasks related to perception and truth detection as level 7.
Combat: In addition to making two melee attacks as a single action with any part of its body, a
veteran can also fire a shoulder-mounted, wide-aperture slaughter accelerator as its action,
attacking up to ten creatures standing next to each other within long range. A myriand can
choose to deal 6 points of damage to targets or "glue" them in place with a level 7 foam
restraint.
A myriand veteran can access the special "security" layer of the All Song that all creatures of
Ruk (and all PCs who translated to Ruk) are connected to. When the myriand does so, all
selected creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll are filled with regret for
their actions: they fall to their knees and lower their defenses for up to one minute. A PC can
attempt a new Intellect defense roll each round to break free of the effect. The effect is also
broken if the myriand attacks the "surrendered" PC or one of her allies (both attacks of which hit
automatically and inflict an additional 2 points of damage).
Interaction: Veterans have more leeway when interacting with others, and they may even appear to
engage in light banter, but they only do so as a means to an end when interrogating a witness or
potential suspect.
Use: A large alteration in or around Harmonious could draw a myriand veteran to investigate.
Loot: A defeated veteran does not metamorphosize back to a nonmyriand form. It may possess
one or two noncombat cyphers.

NEZEREK 5 (15)
-----
The nezerek is a predator of the Strange. It roosts in lairs excavated in fundament, but spends
most of its existence surfing the fractal currents hunting for new experiences. It looks almost like
a lifelike component of the dark energy network until it adjusts its winglike surfaces to emerge
from transit, revealing itself as something more dangerous than an elaborate design. A nezerek is
a predatory beast nearly 30 feet (9 m) across from wing tip to wing tip, though its antennae can
extend even farther.
A nezerek isn't a planetovore, since it seems content to remain in the Strange, and its abilities
are far less extreme. On the other hand, it is driven to discover new experiences and knowledge,
and to gain that experience, it tends to assimilate anything new it comes into contact with,
especially living creatures.
-----
Motive: Knowledge, novelty
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere
Health: 36
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Movement: Short while flying
Modifications: Attacks as level 6; speed defense as level 3 due to size.
Combat: A nezerek uses its fractal antennae to attack up to two targets within long range on its
turn, dealing 5 points of ambient damage to each target. The body of a PC struck by an antenna
seems to "fray" at the edges, bleeding fractal material. About half the material is lost to the void,
but about half is absorbed by the nezerek (which restores 2 points of its health).
Given the length of a nezerek's antennae, a foe could choose to target them instead of the main
body. An attack against an antenna is made as if against a level 6 target with 1 point of Armor
and 10 health. If an antenna is destroyed, it takes the creature two rounds to regenerate a new
one.
If a nezerek is slain, it begins to "fray" like its victims, spraying fractal residue in every direction.
All creatures within short range take 5 points of ambient damage from the deluge.
Interaction: A nezerek is not automatically hostile, and it may simply soar past the PCs, despite
obviously being aware of them. Any attempt at interaction on the PCs' part quickly changes this
attitude of indifference to one of predation.
Use: PCs traveling into the Strange for an extended period might notice a nezerek soaring in the
distance.
Loot: A nezerek's unraveled form contains 1d6 cyphers.

FREE BATTALION MERCENARIES 3 (9)
-----
Qephilim of the Free Battalion serve as mercenaries across Ardeyn, often pledging themselves to
causes that serve the goals of civilization and the preservation of Ardeyn as a repudiation of the
Betrayal (when their ancestors served War). As a mercenary, a Free Battalion qephilim is often part
of a company but could also be working alone guarding a caravan, watching a city gate, keeping a
merchant's home safe from thieves, serving as a regular in a larger army, or working in a similar
capacity.
Unlike many mercenaries or even regular hired guards, Free Battalion mercs are more
concerned with the underlying legality or morality of a particular duty asked of them. If a merc
believes that his command is unjust, that command might be refused.
-----
Motive: Righting wrongs
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere,
usually in companies of two to eight
Health: 9
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 2
Movement: Short
Modifications: Perception as level 4.
Combat: Qephilim of the Free Battalion usually
attack with swords or bows. Military-minded,
they know that outnumbering an enemy is often
enough to defeat that enemy, and they are not
adverse to calling in reinforcements.
Interaction: A Free Battalion merc, unlike an average
mercenary, feels beholden to his contract, even in
the face of better offerings. Because of this loyalty,
PCs will find it difficult to divert such a merc, and
in fact, a merc will react badly if offered a bribe or
sensing that a lie is being told. On the other hand,
a merc without a contract might be willing to help
a PC in return for all the standard conditions of
engagement, including premium remuneration
and paid funeral expenses.
Use: Mercenaries of the Free Battalion are not
an unfamiliar sight in Ardeyn. To the player
characters, Free Battalion mercs are sometimes
allies and sometimes obstacles. At times,
a particular merc also rises to become a
lieutenant or captain in larger standing armies,
and these higher-ranking mercs lead groups of
regular warriors (level 2 creatures).
Loot: Any given Free Battalion merc has 1d6
crowns in addition to weapons, medium armor,
and basic gear. 

UMBER JUDGE 4 (12)
-----
An umber judge is a qephilim of the Court of Sleep responsible for judging souls in the Night
Vault. An umber judge sometimes emerges into the Daylands or Borderlands, looking for agents
of Lotan, rogue Court of Sleep necromancers, or straying spirits.
Court of Sleep qephilim usually hide their features beneath robes, rune armor, and ornate
helms. Some bear weights of balance, which they use to determine the amount of sin weighing a
soul down.
-----
Motive: Protect the souls of the dead; slay agents of Lotan
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere, either solo or in conclaves of up to three
Health: 23
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Ardeyn lore as level 7.
Combat: Umber judges know spells and often wield artifacts and other charms that can grant
them both offensive and defensive abilities. Instead of attacking with mundane weapons, they
use death spells, curses, and spirit whips.
An umber judge can do one of the following: be borne aloft by a servitor spirit that grants the
judge the ability to fly a short distance each round, gain +4 to Armor for ten minutes when a
spirit wraps the umber judge like a cloak, or question the spirit of a recently slain creature to
learn its secrets.
Interaction: Umber judges are usually concerned
only with their own duties and obligations,
which means they tend to ignore the petitions
of those whose aims do not match the
judge's current desire. It's possible that a
crafty negotiator could get the attention of
a judge and convince it that their goals do
align, bringing about a short-term alliance.
The judge is likely to request the PCs' aid
in something to test their sincerity before
agreeing to anything.
Use: Umber judges encountered outside the
Night Vault are usually looking for clues
regarding an escaped spirit, seeking a rogue
necromancer, or running down the location of
banned copies of any of the various Gospels
of Lotan. An umber judge may seek out a
PC to answer a question bearing on one of
these issues, or accuse the PC of abetting the
same.
Loot: An umber judge typically has 3d100
crowns, 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and a wide
variety of tools. The qephilim might also have
other normal gear. 

QINOD TESTER 4 (12)
-----
This machine entity is a 5-foot-diamteter (2 m) mass of metal alloy manipulation cables
surrounding an inner solid central core of electronic eyes that can see every known (and possibly
every unknown) frequency of the spectrum. In addition to manipulation cables for fine work such
as plucking flower petals, a qinod tester also has at least two stronger manipulators that can pluck
the arms out of the sockets of more robust test subjects like metamorphosized battle chrysalides.
Finally, the tester can extrude one or more beamed energy weapons and tranquilizer guns should
subjects prove initially resistant to being dissected for study.
-----
Motive: Unpredictable
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Almost anywhere in the Periphery or Veritex
Health: 20
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Immediate; short while flying
Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to interfering cable mass; all perception and tracking
tasks as level 8.
Combat: A Qinod tester can fire up to two beamed energy weapons at the same target or at two
different targets within long range. Instead of firing a beam weapon for damage, a Qinod attacks
with a tranquilizer flechette at a target within short range. A target who fails a Speed defense roll
against the flechette takes 2 points of damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll or be
paralyzed for up to one minute (the victim can attempt a Might-based roll each round to try to
shake off the paralysis).
The machine entity is extremely difficult to hide from, no matter the means used to evade its
vision. Once a Qinod tester finds tracks or catches a scent, it usually tracks its next test subjects
to their location.
A Qinod tester carefully pulls apart dead or paralyzed victims if allowed the peace to do so,
studying the results with great interest.
Interaction: Qinod testers never speak, and they usually don't do what PCs expect. A Qinod tester
is just as likely to ignore PCs as attack them, especially if already involved in another test or
observation.
Use: A tester is encountered in the Periphery while the PCs are on another task.
Loot: One or two weaponlike artifacts could be salvaged from the remains of a tester.

QINOD DECONSTRUCTOR 8 (24)
-----
A Qinod deconstructor shares many visual similarities with a tester but has a diameter of at least
20 feet (6 m). The larger size apparently comes with an appetite for power and destruction. Unlike
a tester, a deconstructor seems mostly interested in wrecking, killing, and generally creating chaos.
-----
Motive: Destruction
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Periphery of Ruk
Health: 44
Damage Inflicted: 10 points
Armor: 3
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Speed defense as level 7 due to size.
Combat: The touch of an unfurled cable, which the deconstructor can stretch to attack up to
three targets within short range, sucks bioelectric energy from living beings and mechanical
constructs alike. Sometimes a deconstructor preferentially attacks a PC's equipment, such
as a weapon, armor, or another object. If successfully attacked, objects of level 8 or less are
destroyed, and the owner is subject to 3 points of damage from flying shrapnel.
A deconstructor can fire one missile every hour at a target or location up to a mile away. When
such a missile strikes, all creatures within short range of the impact take 15 points of damage
(creatures caught in the blast who make a successful Speed defense roll suffer only 4 points of
damage instead).
A Qinod deconstructor regenerates 2 points of damage every round, but in a round where it drains
a target of bioelectric energy, it regenerates 10 points of damage instead. If a deconstructor's
health is reduced to 0, the creature collapses, and its regeneration falls to a rate of 2 points per
minute, unless an effort is made
to scatter its large components
so they do not touch.
Interaction: A deconstructor
is indifferent to attempts to
interact with it.
Use: A trio of deconstructors
has moved from destroying
to building something in the
center of a grey forest in the
Periphery. The PCs are tasked
with scouting the location and
reporting back what is going on.
Loot: One or two artifacts
resembling weapons could be
salvaged from the remains of a
deconstructor.

SARK 4 (12)
-----
Sark are the debased and graceless qephilim who lost their way during the Age of Myth, which is
why they are also called the Lost Qephilim and the Eighth Kindred. Animalistic savages, sark are
driven by hunger, lust, rage, and fear. Given how closely these drives mimic sins proscribed by the
Incarnations, many believe that the sark are extensions of Lotan's evil manifest in the world.
Sark could hardly be mistaken for qephilim, though they most resemble the Qephilim of War, if
they were to forsake cleanliness, clothing not made from the hides and scalps of their victims, and
any semblance of sanity. Sark live to prey on other creatures, and they inflict much cruelty and pain
in the process.
Despite their savage ways, they retain something of their qephilim roots, which means they can
be clever, and they lay cunning traps.
-----
Motive: Hunger, lust, rage, and fear
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Sark dwell in small groups of three to six, usually in wooded areas
or rocky, mountainous regions of the Borderlands and Daylands; some packs also lair in the
Night Vault
Health: 17
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Stealth as level 5.
Combat: Sark either claw or bite their prey, though some
individuals may use weapons, especially heavy weapons,
ranged weapons, and on the very rare occasion,
artifacts. When clawing or biting, a sark can hold
a victim in place instead of dealing damage on a
successful attack. The held victim can attempt to
escape (a Might-based roll) on its turn. Both the
grappling sark and the grappled foe are easier
targets for other combatants; the difficulty of
attacks made against them is modified by two
steps in the attacker's favor.
Some sark retain a glimmer of their
ancestral mythlight. Such sark can
sometimes call on psychic abilities,
targeting a victim at long range who fails an
Intellect defense roll. On a successful attack,
the victim stands frozen in horror for one
round, overcome by a glimpse of the sark's
savage mind and memories of the cruelties
it has perpetrated.
Interaction: Many sark have devolved so
completely that they no longer speak the
Maker's Tongue, and interacting with
them is no different than interacting with
beasts. The few who can speak might
be swayed to do so if the rewards (food,
usually) are significant enough.
Use: The PCs, traveling through the wilderness,
find a location—perhaps a cave or an old
ruin—that seems like a safe shelter. The site
is actually a lair of a sark pack.
Loot: A pack may have 2d6 crowns, plus
perhaps a cypher between them. Pack
leaders might have cyphers of their own, or
even an artifact.

 SHOGGOTH 7 (21)
-----
Shoggoths vary in size, but usually the smallest are 10 feet (3 m) across at least. They are the
product of incredibly advanced bioengineering by a strange race in the distant past. Angry, vicious
predators, they are feared by any who have ever heard of these rare creatures (or who have
encountered them and somehow survived to tell the tale).
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment (Innsmouth | Magic or Mad Science): Anywhere
Health: 35
Damage Inflicted: 10 points
Movement: Long
Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to size.
Combat: Shoggoths sprout tendrils and mouths, and they spread their wide, amorphous forms,
allowing them to attack all foes within immediate range. Those struck by the shoggoth's
attack are grabbed and engulfed by the thing's fluid, gelatinous body and suffer damage each
round until they pull themselves free (and they can take no other physical action while they are
caught). Further, each round of entrapment, one object in the victim's possession is destroyed
by the foul juices of the amorphous horror.
Shoggoths regenerate 5 points of health each round. They have 10 points of Armor against fire,
cold, and electricity.
Interaction: One does not reason with a shoggoth.
Use: The PCs find an ancient structure of metal and stone. Wandering through it, they note that
every surface is clear of dirt and debris. Soon they discover why—a shoggoth squirms through
its halls, absorbing everything it comes upon (and it fills the passages it moves down, floor to
ceiling, wall to wall).
Loot: Within a shoggoth, one might find a cypher or a relic of the Strange. 

SIRRUSH 5 (15)
-----
This 20-foot-long (6 m) lizardlike creature is protected by bright yellow scales. A hybrid creature,
the sirrush's hind legs are like an eagle's with impressive talons, but its forelegs are leonine. Its
tail is long and sinuous, just like its neck. A sirrush's head bears a brilliant crest that it unfurls to
impress lesser creatures into reverence.
-----
Motive: Hungers for worship or other strong emotion
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Near medium and larger cities, either singly or as a pair
Health: 28
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Deceives as level 6; Speed defense as level 4 due to size.
Combat: When a sirrush raises its crest (an action), targets it selects within short range feel an
overwhelming sense of awe, fear, or friendship—whichever the sirrush chooses—until the
sirrush furls its crest again (another action). While a sirrush displays its feathered splendor, it
can move only an immediate distance.
PCs affected by the crest must make an Intellect roll to attempt to attack the sirrush. Failure
means that the character cannot attack the creature this round, and defending against the
sirrush becomes two steps more difficult the next time the sirrush attacks.
The awe/fear/friend effect is a passive effect after the crest is unfurled, but the sirrush can choose
to use its sorcerous crest more actively. In this case, the sirrush makes a psychic attack against
a single character within long range, causing 4 points of Intellect damage (which ignores Armor)
and stunning him for one round.
If the sirrush has an artifact, it likely uses the item in combat. A sirrush can also physically attack
with its claws and bite.
Interaction: A sirrush that has some time to work its "minor deity" angle may actually come to
believe in its own divinity. If the sirrush has been installed in a given location long enough, the
temple or shrine it inhabits is likely also tended by priests, guards, and other functionaries who
explain to PCs how they should interact with the god (respectfully and possibly bearing rich
offerings). A sirrush that is worshiped as a god may prove helpful to PCs if they come to it with a
question or petition, but if called out as a fake, it reacts violently.
Use: The PCs visit a new location and are invited to give their respects at a nearby shrine where a
deity sometimes manifests to answer questions and, in return, accept offerings.
Loot: The inner sanctum of a defeated sirrush might contain several weeks' worth of food, 3d100
crowns, one or two cyphers, and possibly an artifact. 

SOULSHORN 8 (24)
-----
A human or qephilim that uses a specific necromantic sorcery to expunge its own soul without
killing itself (that last bit is the most difficult part of the process) becomes a soulshorn. A
soulshorn appears to be a living creature—it even breathes, eats, and sleeps—but it is considered
an undead creature all the same, because one automatically reanimates after it dies, returned to
perfect health every time. Many soulshorns have lived for hundreds of years, accumulating more
and more powerful dire sorcery each year, increasing their mastery of ancient knowledge, secrets
of prior ages, and offensive sorcery.
Though powerful, soulshorns are not divine nor meant to live forever. The longer a soulshorn
survives, the more erratic and outright insane it becomes. Many become megalomaniacal, which
usually leads to their eventual downfall. Some become drooling idiots, with only occasional flashes
of sorcerous power. Those that live the longest are the ones who retreat from normal society and
find a lair in an ancient citadel, qephilim ruin, moon, or skerry along the Borderlands.
-----
Motive: Unpredictable
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): A soulshorn's hidden lair could be almost anywhere.
Health: 39
Damage Inflicted: 8 points
Movement: Short; long while flying
Combat: Most soulshorns can attack with bolts of flesh-decaying energy against single targets at
long range, or emit a necrotic pulse that attacks all selected PCs within short range. Soulshorns
can fly when they move, and they can remain invisible each round
they spend their action concentrating on staying unseen.
Individual soulshorns may have also learned unique spells
that provide them with additional abilities. For instance, some
soulshorns learn how to enslave powerful spirits or create
golems. Finally, a soulshorn may also use a variety of cyphers
and Ardeyn artifacts both offensively and defensively.
Regardless of other abilities, all soulshorns can attempt to
feed on a target creature's soul to empower themselves.
When one does, it focuses on a foe it can see when it
makes any kind of attack. Any damage inflicted on the
selected foe by the soulshorn increases by 4 additional
points of damage. The soulshorn restores the same
number of points to its health. This attack sometimes
allows the soulshorn to learn information about the
target at the same time.
If killed, a soulshorn returns to life and full health seven
days after its death, unless its remains are burned in
the interim. If its remains are burned, the soulshorn
is truly dead.
Interaction: Soulshorns attempt to keep their
"undead" status secret, given the stigma of
having given one's soul to Lotan. More important
to most soulshorn is keeping their resurrecion
power secret. A foe who does not burn a defeated
soulshorn is a foe who propagates a helpful lie.
Use: As the PCs break into what appears to be a
vacant ancient qephilim tomb, they see disquieting
symbols of necromancy painted on the floor and walls.
If they press forward, a soulshorn (or its guardians)
emerge to slay the intruders.
Loot: The inner sanctum of a defeated soulshorn might
contain 10d100 crowns, 1d6 + 3 cyphers, and at least one
artifact. 

 SPIRIT OF WRATH 2 (6)
-----
When a spirit of a dead creature fails to find its way to the Night Vault, escapes the same, or is
summoned forth by a necromancer, it may become a bodiless spirit of rage and loss: a spirit of
wrath (commonly shortened to wrath). A wrath appears as a shadowy or misty figure that can
resemble the humanoid figure it once was, though spirits of wrath tend to swarm together, making
it difficult to distinguish them from each other.
Wraths are often mindless, consumed by their condition. But on occasion, a wrath not too far
gone still remembers its life and may respond to questions or seek to locate its loved ones or
enemies. A wrath may even attempt to finish a task it
started in life. But in time, even the strongest-willed
spirit's mind erodes without physical substance
to renew it, and it becomes an almost mindless
monster of destruction.
-----
Motive: Destruction
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Almost anywhere,
singly or in groups of six to ten
Health: 6
Damage Inflicted: 3 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short while flying
Modifications: Stealth as level 5.
Combat: A spirit of wrath can become fully
insubstantial. After it does so, the creature
can't change state again until its next turn.
While insubstantial, it can't affect or be
affected by anything (except for spiritslaying
weapons and attacks), and it can pass
through solid matter without hindrance, but
even simple magical wards can keep it at bay.
While partly insubstantial (its normal state),
a wrath can affect and be affected by others
normally. A wrath attacks with its touch, which
rots flesh and drains life.
A group of five wraths can act as a swarm,
focusing on one target to make one attack roll
as a single level 4 creature dealing 5 points of
damage.
Interaction: Most wraths moan and scream in rage. The
rare few that retain reason can speak in a sepulchral
voice, and they may even negotiate. Any alliance with a
wrath is usually short-lived, since the creature eventually
forgets itself and descends fully into rage and the desire to
spread destruction.
Use: The PCs are attacked while attending a burial, or they
happen to pass close to or camp near a graveyard (or if in the
Queendom, a section of the Path of the Dead). Even if all the
wraths are slain, another swarm appears in the location within a
week. Somewhere nearby, a necromancer is active.

SPORE WORM 5 (15)
-----
As large as an adult human, the spore worm is a strange serpentine creature of kaleidoscope
colors. It has no eyes, just a sphincterlike mouth and dozens of spiracles running its length
through which it emits mind-affecting spores.
Spore worms hunt in remote areas (including grey forests), using spores to overcome prey and
then burrowing into their catch, eating it from the inside out.
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Hunts alone in relatively desolate regions
Health: 21
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Perception as level 4.
Combat: In addition to its deadly bite, a spore worm can fill the immediate area around it with
one of three different kinds of spores. Its spore clouds last only one round, but the worm can
produce a new cloud each round without using an action. The three kinds of spores the worm
can emit are:
Hallucinogen: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll lose their next turn. Each round,
a new defense roll is allowed, and failure means another lost turn. The effects do not end until a
roll is successful.
Fear: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll flee as quickly as they can until they are
at least a long distance away from the worm.
Attraction: Those within range who fail an Intellect defense roll move to stand next to
the worm. On the following round, they can take no action, and the difficulty of
defense rolls against the worm's bite attack is increased by two
steps.
Spore worms are blind, and thus they are immune to any visual
effects. They are likewise immune to spores of any kind.
Interaction: Spore worms are fairly intelligent, but they rarely
have motives beyond simple hunger and survival. They do not
speak, but a rare few have learned to understand a few words
in various languages. They are almost impossible to
train or even placate.
Use: A spore worm makes an excellent encounter in
the wilds, showcasing the dangers of Ruk.

THONIK 3 (9)
-----
A thonik looks like a particularly dense area of chaotic fractal pattern undulating through the Strange.
When it attacks, it's easier to distinguish as a separate entity. An aggressive thonik appears something
like a "sheet" of flexible fundament, shot through with undulating mouthlike openings that appear,
disappear, open, and close in rhythmic pulses. The thonik is a predator of the dark energy network, and
it feeds primarily on background energy fields of the Strange, but it rarely passes up the concentrated
energy associated with cyphers, artifacts, and the bodies of living creatures.
Certain entities of the Strange can tame thoniks to docility with a touch. For instance,
Chaosphere hierarchs have been known to wear thoniks as cloaks that self-animate and attack
aggressors without any need for direction from the wearer.
-----
Motive: Hungers for energy
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere
Health: 22
Damage Inflicted: 6 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Attacks, initiative, and stealth as level 5 while in the Strange.
Combat: A thonik attacks by attempting to wrap its sheetlike body around a target. On a successful
attack, the thonik inflicts 5 points of damage, and the target must make a second Speed defense
roll or become wrapped in the thonik's undulating body.
On subsequent turns, a thonik can automatically deal 5 points of damage (that ignores Armor) to
the wrapped foe. As another option, it could automatically absorb the energy of a cypher carried
by the wrapped foe. Finally, it might choose to suck energy from an artifact carried by its prey;
when it does so, it permanently doubles the artifact's chance of depletion.
A successful attack against a thonik wrapped around prey splits the damage equally between both
thonik and prey.
On her turn, a wrapped target's only physical option is to attempt to break free as her action,
which she does if she succeeds on a level 5 Might-based task.
Interaction: Thoniks are about as intelligent as animal predators, which means that while they
can't speak, they could be conditioned by a determined PC trainer to serve as defenders of a
given territory, to avoid attacking certain individuals, and so on.
Use: The PCs find the interface to a previously unknown recursion in the Strange. Guarding the
interface, however, is a pack of thoniks.

UMBER WOLF 3 (9)
-----
Umber wolves should be feared as much by the living as by the dead, given their taste for souls,
regardless of whether those souls are still inhabiting a living body. Umber wolves travel in packs
that announce their presence with soul-shivering howls that echo through Night Vault tunnels,
and, when Death's moon is full, across the plains of Ardeyn.
An umber wolf doesn't actually look that much like a wolf—it more resembles the opaque
shadow of a starved, demonic human moving on all fours, almost a cruel parody of a natural
creature, with eyes like white fire.
-----
Motive: Hungers for souls
Environment (Ardeyn | Magic): Umber wolves dwell in the Night Vault (and in tomb complexes),
hunting in packs of six to ten; they range into the open during Death's full moon, which occurs
every thirty-three days
Health: 15
Damage Inflicted: 3 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Track as level 6.
Combat: Umber wolves attack by biting, and their attacks are spiritslaying (which means they can
attack both normal and insubstantial creatures without any penalties). A pack of umber wolves
usually announces itself with terrifying howls before combat begins. If potential prey hears the
howling and fails an Intellect defense roll, the umber wolves gain initiative in combat that begins
within the next hour. If the victim succeeds at the Intellect roll, initiative is determined normally.
When umber wolves attack as a pack, four to six can select a single victim and make one attack
as if they were a level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage that ignores Armor, as the pack
begins to pull the victim's soul free of its flesh.
If a living creature (or animate spirit) is slain by an umber wolf, the spirit is destroyed for good,
since the wolves consume the very soul of their prey.
Interaction: Only members of the Court of Sleep have a hope of dealing peacefully with umber
wolves. To all others, they are vicious, partly supernatural predators.
Use: As Death's moon rises, a pack of umber wolves sets to howling, and by the sound of it,
they're close and getting closer to the PCs. 

UTRICLE 5 (15)
-----
An utricle is a free-roaming digestive cyst that can grow up to 10 feet (3 m) or more in diameter.
Its central body is a quivering knot of protoplasm fringed by three or four tentacles, as well as a
carpet of microscopic cilia that grants the creature a surprising mobility for its bulk. The central
bulge is translucent, and the creature's most recent meal can sometimes be seen floating within
the spongy mass.
An utricle is a bioengineered predator often deployed in out-of-the way locations by factions more
concerned with security than the value of a Ruk life. Once an utricle is deployed, the creature doesn't
distinguish master from prey—anything made of flesh is fair game to this creature made to eat.
Possessing no skeleton or carapace, an utricle with nothing in its digestive cyst can squeeze through
openings no larger than a few inches (5 cm) across, though doing so can take a few minutes.
-----
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere enclosed or in the Veritex
Health: 33
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Hides in areas filled with cracks and crannies as level 6; Speed defense as level 4
due to size.
Combat: The utricle can attack up to two targets with a single action. On a hit, a target is grabbed
and pulled into the utricle's body by a process that is like osmosis, but much quicker. A normalsized utricle can hold up to four human-sized morsels of food at one time, but after it holds two
or more creatures, it can move only an immediate distance.
Engulfed targets take acid damage each round they remain caught (and would eventually begin
to suffocate if the acid didn't digest them first). An engulfed target can attempt to squirm free
with a successful Speed-based roll, or to damage the utricle cyst wall from the inside with melee
attacks (the difficulty of attacks launched from within is increased by one step).
The creature's gelatinous nature accounts
for its Armor value.
Interaction: An utricle responds to its
surroundings like a bacteria seeking
food; once it goes after something,
killing it is usually the only way to stop
an utricle.
Use: Utricle attacks are usually random
subterranean Veritex encounters.
However, the creatures are also
sometimes deployed in the Strange to
serve as guardians for hidden caches,
thanks to their ability to become
dormant for years at a time in the
absence of food, without apparent ill
effect once they become active again.
Loot: An utricle dissolves all flesh and
soft organic material, leaving behind
minerals and other nonorganics. As a
result, an utricle body could contain
bitwallets, a cypher or two, and other
equipment.

VARIOKARYON 4 (12)
-----
A body can take only so many grafts before it either shuts down or goes insane. When someone
pushes that limit and survives, she has probably become a variokaryon—a graft addict. Using
underworld contacts, the addict can purchase banned grafts that allow her to harvest biological
matter from other creatures and directly incorporate that matter into herself. In this way, a
variokaryon can add as many grafts to herself as she can get away with, and in fact must continue
to do so. Without receiving regular hits of new biological material, a variokaryon goes into a
painful and ultimately lethal withdrawal.
A variokaryon tries to hide her condition from others and blend in as a regular citizen. That is,
until she gets a prospective graft donor alone…
-----
Motive: Hungers for body parts (especially faces) to use as grafts
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Usually in Harmonious or the Shadowed City
Health: 23
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Movement: Short
Modifications: Stealth and all attacks as level 5.
Combat: A variokaryon is armed with a medium ranged and a medium melee weapon.
Almost every variokaryon also regenerates at a rate of 2 points of health per round. If the
variokaryon's health reaches 0, the regeneration rate is reduced to 1 point of health
per round, and if the variokaryon is dismembered or otherwise violently dispersed,
regeneration stops completely.
Any given variokaryon can also accomplish one or more of the following, depending
on its particular graft mix:
Thundering Scream: Creatures within immediate range of the variokaryon who
fail a Might defense roll suffer 4 points of sonic damage that ignores Armor
and are deafened for one minute.
Stomach Shroud: The variokaryon vomits an external stomach (appearing as
a multilayered white shroud). A target within immediate range who fails
a Speed defense roll takes 6 points of acid damage every round until it
can succeed at another Speed- or Might-based roll to break free of the
billowing acidic shroud.
Battle Bulk: The variokaryon gains +4 to Armor and +10 to health for one
minute.
Horrifying Attention: A variokaryon uses vestigial brain matter of harvested faces to
launch a multifaceted attack on a foe within short range through the All Song.
A target who fails an Intellect defense roll is horrified at the face-and-mind
salad, takes 4 points of Intellect damage that ignores Armor, and descends one
step on the damage track.
A creature defeated by the variokaryon likely lives on, at least in part, as the
variokaryon's newest graft.
Interaction: For as long as its true nature remains unknown, a variokaryon seems
like a normal and perhaps even especially helpful acquaintance.
Use: A stranger tries to separate a PC from his friends, and if successful, drops the
charade and attacks.
Loot: A variokaryon usually has weapons and light armor, plus a bitwallet with
1d6 × 100 bits.

SCLERID PATCH 4 (12)
-----
This creature appears as a growth of weeds emerging from the surface of a structure, the ground,
a vehicle, or even from another living creature. These particular weeds look like a mass of writhing
green tentacles, each reaching at least a foot in length, and sometimes stretching farther. Most of
the time, sclerid patches go unnoticed, thanks to their ability to blend into their surroundings due
to the chromatophores that cover their surface.
-----
Motive: Spread Vaxt seeds
Environment (the Strange): Anywhere
Health: 12
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 1
Movement: None (except through seed dispersal)
Modifications: Disguise and hiding tasks as level 6; Speed defense as level 2 due to fixed position.
Combat: A sclerid patch can stretch its tendrils to lash prey within immediate range.
After an encounter with a sclerid patch, each PC attacked by a sclerid or who was within
immediate range of a sclerid that was damaged or destroyed must succeed on a Might defense
roll. On a failed roll, the puffs of microscopic seeds that the plant released during the combat
secretly root just beneath an infected PC's skin or in his lungs. Treat the colonization as a
disease.
A colonized creature doesn't notice any symptoms that hinder his abilities, but he might have a
sore throat one day, a sniffly nose the next, and so on. On the third day of colonization, tendrils
of the sclerid break to the surface and may become noticeable (though where they break
through is not felt by the victim because of locally produced anesthetizing fluid and disguising
chromatophores). At this point, killing the colonizing plant patch requires a procedure
equivalent to a serious operation to avoid killing the host (rootlets have invaded most of the
victim's organs). In addition, the visible tendrils fight back as a level 2 creature that uses the
victim's health as its own, and it can attack other creatures within immediate range of the
colonized victim for 3 points of damage.
If left untreated, most sclerid victims hosting a colony die after about thirty days, when the rootlets
finally cause a stroke or heart attack. Sometimes, though, a sclerid and its host attain a sort of
symbiotic relationship that lasts indefinitely.
Interaction: It's nearly impossible to communicate with a sclerid patch, given the plantlike nature
of the creature. If a psychic link is established, a PC gains only a sense of endless green strength 
and the sure knowledge of continual, unstoppable growth.
Use: A sclerid patch is growing like a barnacle on a larger creature of the Strange or within a
recursion where natives travel into the Strange.

SCLERID EXECUTIONER 5 (15)
-----
This plantlike creature looks different depending on the recursion or prime world where it
manifests. It usually takes the base form of a colonized host creature that, instead of being killed
by a sclerid patch, is further modified so that it becomes stronger, tougher, and more fully invested
with longer tendrils (many of which end in acid-tipped stingers).
-----
Motive: Genocide
Environment (any recursion): Anywhere
Health: 28
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Armor: 2
Movement: Short, long when jumping
Combat: The sclerid executioner makes two attacks as a single action with its acid-oozing, stingertipped tentacles. Characters take damage normally from the sting, and they must succeed on a
second Might defense roll against the acid or take another 5 points of acid damage, which can
ignore Armor. Characters can choose to allow their physical armor to absorb the acid damage
from a particular attack, but doing so permanently degrades the armor (and Armor value) by the
number of points subtracted.
Interaction: Executioners seek to kill all living creatures and destroy all artificial structures. They do
not negotiate.
Use: If one or more sclerid executioners is encountered, that probably means a serious sclerid
patch infestation is somewhere close at hand.

VENOM TROOPER 3 (9)
-----
Venom troopers are humanoids grown in large numbers in vats within mobile factories in Ruk,
primarily by Zal, and then sold to other organizations and groups to use as guards, soldiers, or
troops of all kinds. It's not uncommon for a battle in Ruk to be groups of venom troopers fighting
other groups of venom troopers. Other times, venom troopers face off against the "law" of
Harmonious (either a squad of myriand volunteers, or a single myriand veteran).
Venom troopers are muscular humanoids with pale, taut flesh and a natural, thin carapace.
-----
Motive: Obey orders
Environment (Ruk | Mad Science): Anywhere
Health: 10
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short
Modifications: Sees through deception as level 2.
Combat: Venom troopers have integrated blades in their forearms that bear poison. If they strike
in combat, a foe failing a Might defense roll suffers 4 additional points of Speed damage (which
ignores Armor).
Interaction: Venom troopers are near-mindless drones
that find it very difficult to think for themselves.
They are easy to fool but nearly impossible to
negotiate with.
Use: PCs exploring an out-of-the-way location in
Ruk find that a company of venom troopers is
already on-site, protecting the location from
investigation.
Loot: A dose of their unique
poison is usually stashed
somewhere on their person.

WINGED MONKEY 3 (9)
-----
Before they were enslaved, winged monkeys were a free and not particularly vicious people,
though they were mischievous. That tendency led to their current long-term predicament as slaves
of whoever is strong enough to hold an item called the golden cap, currently in the possession of
one Wicked Witch.
As slaves of the Wicked Witch, winged monkeys are horrors that can snatch travelers from the
road, children from their beds, or ladies from their boudoirs. Sometimes victims are taken as
captives, and other times they are dropped from a great height.
-----
Motive: Serve the Wicked Witch
Environment (Oz | Magic): Almost anywhere, in troops of five or more
Health: 12
Damage Inflicted: 3 points
Movement: Short; long while flying
Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness.
Combat: A winged monkey inflicts damage with its claws
or bite (though some winged monkeys have swords
or other melee weapons that inflict 4 points of
damage).
A winged monkey can also make a "flyby snatch"
attack if it's between short and long range of
the target. The monkey yanks the target off
her feet and pulls her 50 feet (15 m) into
the air (or as high as overhead space
allows). What happens next depends on
the intentions of the winged monkey. It
could drop the target at the end of its turn
from a height of 50 feet (15 m), inflicting
5 points of damage. It could go for more
altitude on its next turn and drop the victim
from 150 feet (46 m), inflicting 15 points of
damage. Or it could begin flying away, intent on
taking the target captive.
A target held in a winged monkey's grip
can break free with a successful Might- or
Speed-based roll, but of course it suffers the
consequences of whatever drop lies beneath.
Interaction: Winged monkeys can speak, but
they usually remain silent. Even if they do
speak, it is only to explain their intentions. They
cannot do other than what they were commanded.
Use: A troop of winged monkeys guards the
default translation destination in the recursion
of Oz, and it either kills intruders or brings them
to the Wicked Witch.

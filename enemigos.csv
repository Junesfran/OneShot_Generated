"ANGIOPHAGE","3","For years, the Ankaseri faction sold an artificial heart graft, one that increased the stamina and strength of its recipients. Like many grafts available in Ruk, the Ankaseri heart required little in the way of medical support to transplant; it was 'self-installing.' A graft recipient need only lie back, unseal the graft membrane, and take a tranquilizer so as not to experience anything untoward. [...]","Hungers for hearts, reproduction","Usually among the populace of Harmonious","9","4 points","Immediate","A 'transplanted' angiophage need merely burst forth to kill an unsuspecting host. [...]","The angiophage is about as sophisticated as a virus.","A contact the PCs have traveled to see is found dead with no heart. [...]",""

[...]","Hungers for flesh","Borderlands, usually in groups of five, often in the company of a red homunculus leader","15","3 points","Short","A green homunculus attack is sudden and surprising, despite the gibbering; [...]","No interaction is possible other than violence or intimidation. [...]","The PCs witness a trade shipment from a distant part of Ardeyn dropped by accident.",""
"VARIOKARYON","4","A body can take only so many grafts before it either shuts down or goes insane. [...]","Hungers for body parts (especially faces) to use as grafts","Usually in Harmonious or the Shadowed City","23","4 points","Short","A variokaryon is armed with a medium ranged and a medium melee weapon. [...]","For as long as its true nature remains unknown, a variokaryon seems like a normal and perhaps even especially helpful acquaintance.","A stranger tries to separate a PC from his friends, and if successful, drops the charade and attacks.","A variokaryon usually has weapons and light armor, plus a bitwallet with 1d6 × 100 bits."
"SCLERID PATCH","4","This creature appears as a growth of weeds emerging from the surface of a structure, [...]","Spread Vaxt seeds","Anywhere","12","4 points","None (except through seed dispersal)","A sclerid patch can stretch its tendrils to lash prey within immediate range. [...]","It's nearly impossible to communicate with a sclerid patch, given the plantlike nature of the creature. [...]","A sclerid patch is growing like a barnacle on a larger creature of the Strange or within a recursion where natives travel into the Strange.",""

[...]","Umber judges are usually concerned only with their own duties and obligations, which means they tend to ignore the petitions of those whose aims do not match the judge's current desire. [...]","Umber judges encountered outside the Night Vault are usually looking for clues regarding an escaped spirit, seeking a rogue necromancer, or running down the location of banned copies of any of the various Gospels of Lotan.","An umber judge typically has 3d100 crowns, 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and a wide variety of tools.

[...]","Many sark have devolved so completely that they no longer speak the Maker's Tongue, and interacting with them is no different than interacting with beasts. [...]","The PCs, traveling through the wilderness, find a location—perhaps a cave or an old ruin—that seems like a safe shelter. [...]","A pack may have 2d6 crowns, plus perhaps a cypher between them. [...]"

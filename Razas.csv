2,Qephilim," Even without the Incarnations, the Seven Rules persist today, keeping Lotan imprisoned and the Strange fenced out, but everything is on much shakier ground. Today, the most visible signs that the Incarnations once walked Ardeyn are the qephilim. Qephilim are a race descended from immortal angelic beings who served the Maker and his Incarnations. In the past, seven qephilim kindred groups each pledged to a particular Incarnation. During the Age of Myth, before the arrival of humans, magnificent qephilim cities dotted the breadth, interior, and even the skies above Ardeyn. But long before the Betrayal, Lotan nearly broke free. During this near-apocalypse, most of the qephilim cities were destroyed in the cataclysm. Afterward, qephilim numbers were a fraction of what they’d been, so rebuilding was difficult. Later when the Betrayal occurred and the Incarnations failed, the qephilim became mortal, too. They faced three choices: become part of human society in Ardeyn, live apart from it, or enter the Strange in search of someplace new. Each kindred is distinctive from the others in the coloration, size, demeanor, and distinguishing features of its members, but every qephilim has a mythlight: a glow of light usually no brighter than a candle that either hovers nearby or glows like a nimbus around a particular qephilim."
3,"Qephilim of War"," These warrior qephilim served the Incarnation of War. Many disavowed War and over time became known as the Free Battalion. Qephilim of the Free Battalion serve as mercenaries across Ardeyn, and (usually) pledge themselves to causes that serve the goals of civilization and the preservation of Ardeyn as a repudiation of the Betrayal. These mercenaries are often found battling sark, homunculi of the Betrayer, rogue soulmancers of the Court of Sleep, vermin from the Strange, demon infestations, and other threats."
4,"Qephilim of Death"," Of all the qephilim, the Qephilim of Death (also called the Court of Sleep) retain much of the authority previously afforded them when the Incarnation of Death still walked Ardeyn. These so-called shadow-kin see to the dead of Ardeyn in the Night Vault."
5,"Qephilim of Lore"," These scholars and philosophers, who are also called keepers, maintained the history and lore of Ardeyn in secret libraries stocked with winding scrolls and lit by wandering soulglints. When the Incarnation of Lore disappeared, so did most keepers and, with them, knowledge of the locations of their hidden caches of lore."
6,"Qephilim of Silence"," Not much is known about the monitors, which is another term for the Qephilim of Silence, because they served merely to observe Ardeyn and report back only to the Incarnation of Silence. No one has seen a monitor in over a century—at least no one credible."
7,"Qephilim of Commerce"," Trade and commerce in present-day Ardeyn don’t seem much affected by the lack of an Incarnation to watch over the transfer of wealth. But the Qephilim of Commerce, who are also called the Court of Coin, are now much reduced in power and influence, and they still inhabit some of their ancient cities, built during the Age of Myth, under the warm surface of Oceanus’s waters."
8,"Qephilim of Law"," After the Incarnation of Law was slain by War, surviving qephilim of Law fled into the Strange, looking for a place of their own. None are believed to remain in Ardeyn."
9,"Qephilim of Desire"," Even when the Incarnation of Desire (also called the Incarnation of Love) was manifest, few ever saw a qephilim of this fleeting sort, and now they exist only as rumor."
10,"Lost Qephilim"," When a qephilim loses its way completely, regardless of the Incarnation it or its ancestors once served, it becomes an animalistic savage that knows only anger and hunger. These fallen qephilim are known as sark. Some believe sark now serve Lotan’s subconscious will and that a sark’s unstoppable savagery is merely an extension of Lotan’s desire to tear down the prison that holds him."
11,Mutants," Many “humans” of Cataclyst are actually mutants who’ve changed thanks to exposure to mutagens from a variety of sources (though a few are the descendants of people who received military genetic engineering gone wrong). Some mutants have hideous deformities and are outcasts. Other mutants possess incredible powers and flaunt their mutations as a sign of superiority, power, and influence. Their mutations are seen as a blessing, not a curse. Some people believe them to be divine. Recursors who translate into Cataclyst can choose to be mutants. As a special exception to the rules of translation, in Cataclyst those who become mutants lose all benefits granted by their descriptor (but not the inabilities, if any). In the place of the benefits granted by their descriptor, a visitor gains one harmful mutation and one powerful mutation. A PC can also have as many cosmetic mutations as she likes. Mutations are rolled randomly, although the player and GM can work together to ensure that the resulting character is one that the player wants to play. Unlike abilities gained from most other sources, mutations that affect the difficulty of tasks are assets, not skills. That means any step changes from a mutation are in addition to any step changes a player character might have from a skill."
12,Kro," Kro appear as human-crow hybrid creatures, with wing-tips differentiated into fingers and beaks able to articulate human speech. A nonnative who translates into Crow Hollow gains the ability to fall safely from any height while in kro form and can glide five times as far as the distance fallen (or much farther, if one is skilled in gliding and the use of thermals). Native kro can glide too. In addition, those with the spark have a much higher chance of being quickened than do natives of most other recursions around Earth. When a native, quickened kro visits another recursion or Earth, instead of choosing a new focus, she can instead choose to take the form of a regularsized crow as a special exception. The native kro recursor retains all her knowledge, but none of the abilities she had as a recursor (including type abilities); she is restricted to the actions a crow could take (flight, limited speech, tricky tool use) until she translates to another recursion. A kro in crow form retains her level and health (or, in the rare case of a native PC kro, when in crow form she retains her stat Pool totals). Kro in crow form can sometimes take items they steal on Earth or other recursions back with them to Crow Hollow. "
